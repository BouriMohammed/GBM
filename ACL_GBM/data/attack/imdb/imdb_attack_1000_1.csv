perfect double bill for the horribly corny `` beverly hillbillies '' is this equally atrocious lame brained 'comedy `` son in law '' country girl rebecca goes to wild california to attend college only to be assaulted by the lifestyle 'resident adviser `` crawl '' helps her settle in and soon the two are good friends bec decides to bring the wacky `` crawl '' home for thanksgiving with obvious `` fish out of water '' results the only other comic angle steve rash aptly named achieves here is a sexual one this he bludgeons us with but to no avail both comic aspects fail dismally and you know the film is groping when `` crawl '' hijacks the combine harvester and writes his name in the corn field dramatically the movie falls short too with several attempts at family and personal counselling from `` crawl '' misfiring between them pauly shore and carla gugino manage to raise a couple of smiles but little else while the rest of the cast are mere fodder the problem is it 's nearly impossible to actually like `` crawl '' and you 'll find yourself spending the whole flick wondering why rebecca would want to spend a moment with him however if you 're a fan of unintelligent comedy `` son in law '' is right on the mark sunday november 10 1996 t.v,0
two funeral directors in a welsh village english humour as opposed to that other stuff from over the atlantic how could i resist my wife and i saw it on march the 6th for our belated valentines day celebration and both of us enjoyed some good belly laughs we were going to see another movie later but decided not to because we wanted the experience of this movie to stay with us for the evening the mortuary scene in the last 20 minutes of the film is worth the wait it raises issues rarely talked about in the community but i know three funeral directors and the humour is right on the money highly recommended and congratulations to the writers without you all the actors directors and the others hav n't a job on any monday,1
may contain spoilers i was super excited to go see blood and chocolate with my friends i could n't wait because the book is one of my favorites but as soon as the movie started i could n't believe how different it was at first i was like okay so both of her parents are dead ... maybe it 'll be okay but then came the rest of the movie by the time it was over i was furious nothing was correct but their names and the fact that vivian fell in love with aiden by the end of the book gabriel was my all time favorite ... and then the movie goes and turns him into a complete heartless idiot the movie also showed the shifters or werewolves as these vile evil creatures were as the book shows them as just wanting to fit in and keep their pack safe they would never kill humans for the fun of it if they wanted to make a movie like they did they should have given it a different title and named the characters different because then i would go out and watch it again and buy it but when i think about it all i can see is the bad you could n't pay me to go see it again or buy it,0
the frozen limits is a big screen vehicle for the artists known as the crazy gang they were a group of british entertainers who formed in the early 1930s in the main the group 's six men were bud flanagan chesney allen jimmy nervo teddy knox charlie naughton and jimmy gold hugely popular in the variety halls the group were also darlings of the then royal family the plot here sees them as the wonder boys troupe who set off to seek their fortunes in alaska after reading about a gold rush in the newspaper only problem is is that when they finally get to red gulch it turns out they are 40 years too late i often cringe when i see the statement `` it 's very british '' because it implies that those not of the british isles may struggle to get it the reason it bothers me is because in this www/internet age i have garnered a ream of non british film loving friends who have been known to split their sides at the best of ealing will hay and the imperious terry-thomas so then is it true that something such as the frozen limits is unlikely to be appreciated by a non british audience well yes it 's true so much here is topically british but really it has to be said that the classic movie fan is pretty well versed in history and when all is said and done the visual mirth here is universal with the anarchic `` not '' so wild west make over an absolute winner a winner that has every chance of being more appreciated by an american audience now than it will be by a british audience not all the comedy works and in truth the `` big 6 '' are trumped big time by a film stealing moore marriott but there are skits and parodies here that deserve respect and a nod of approval from more illustrious comedy acts you are unlikely to nearly fall off your chair like i did because of an ovaltine gag but if you be a classic comedy film fan i feel sure that you will at the worst acknowledge there 's some very talented people at work here now then dose the mounties always get their man 8/10,1
for anyone who has trouble with naughty mad or troublesome kids this is an essential programme to watch it is just the best behaviour documentary programme not just for tips but for the transformations the quite attractive jo frost is supernanny with fifteen years of nannying experience she now has a programme where she shows a family where the kids are misbehaving very very badly frost is the nanny who does not let the kids win every episode they have young kids who are mad and very very naughty e.g throwing things constantly swearing hitting relatives and parents and many other horrible experiences but every episode by the end of the show the kids are transformed by the parents with the help of frost from little monsters to lovable children it is just wonderful when the transformations are successful jo frost is an excellent supernanny it was nominated the national television award for most popular factual programme twice it was number 15 on the 100 greatest tv treats 2004. very good,1
one of those movies in which there are no big twists whatsoever and you can predict pretty much whats is going to happen matt dillon was awesome once again but the rest did n't played a bigger part as they should have it was exciting in the beginning but kinda slow paced and predictable in the end.its one of those flicks in which the good guy wins no matter happens.if you have absolutely nothing to do you can give it a try i personally found it not worth watching the story could have been more interesting and the director could have made it less of a b-movie by engineering a happy ending,0
consider `` i know all '' action hero is lighting a cigarette in the darkness while tries to hide/seek the bad guys probably to give a signal light to say here i am coming that 's one of the 100 scenes you can laugh at i think the movie should in the comedy category awful directing awful script bad acting cheap special effects they used a tunnel so they can hide there acting in darkness 3 out of 10 that also for making me laugh looking at those pathetic mistakes,0
well i 've watched this movie for over 25 years now and it 's still almost as interesting as when i first saw it it is definitely one of the most unique films ever made i still think martin sheen got `` dissed '' big-time in the billing too he dominates the film yet gets lesser billing than marlon brando who only appears in the last 30 minutes of this 2 hours 17 minutes film theatrical version how unfair is that sheen is fantastic in here especially his narration which runs throughout it 's one of the best narrations if not the best i have ever heard in a movie his voice is just haunting as he relates his thoughts on this incredible nightmare-like adventure i never fail to appreciate his work in this movie the other thing that strikes me about the film over the years are the number of memorable scenes ones i have never forgotten such as ...... sheen losing it in his hotel room in the movie 's first scene robert duvall and the totally out-of-place surfing scenes and then the ensuing attack with wagner 's dramatic classical music blaring out of the helicopters the playboy bunny entertaining the troops frederic forrest being freaked out seeing a tiger close up in the jungle the weird scenes on the long riverboat ride the appearance of hippie journalist dennis hopper greeting the crew in cambodia and then brando 's bizarre character it goes on and on with strange scenes that 's not to say i enjoyed everything no there are a few very unpleasant scenes such as the one in which an ox is sliced in half ca n't watch that anymore an innocent family is slaughtered on a small boat by sheen 's young stoned-out crew and the crew is a little too goofy at times then there is the huge amount of profanity led by way too many f-words so there is a lot of good and a lot of bad things in this movie for almost anyone who watches this one thing for sure it is a film you will remember,1
this classic has so many great one-liners and unintentionally hilarious scenes that i do n't even know where to start if you want advice on dating its here just totally ignore the person you want and then spout out classic lines like `` chicken 's good ... i like chicken '' and before you know it you will be having a one-nighter in a basement it 's a nice basement with a woman who is 35 years younger than you bronson does it all in this film he buys a car for no good reason just so he can murder two gang members ... paying with `` cash '' ...... chunnng .... he buys an ice cream simply because `` this is america is n't it '' and ends up wasting someone named `` the giggler he laughs when he runs '' just because he stole his camera by the way this `` giggler '' is so fast that bronson 's regular pistol ca n't even catch up to him he needs to order a special one just to get this elusive creep he gets cleaned up just so he can eat a really smelly meal stuffed cabbage in a rat trap with a couple of old people who like to wear heavy clothing in 90 degree weather he goes into the dentistry business he always seems to find a crow bar when he needs one and its the same one and last but not least he always seems to have a rocket launcher at his disposal just in case he needs to blow away richie cunningham 's older brother chuck who is now strung out and in dire need of a makeover anyway this will all make sense once you have seen this classic ... all i can say is enjoy `` i owed you that one dude '',1
"red sonja is a career-step-in-the-wrong-direction for arnold schwarzenegger having made a couple of sword 'n sorcery films as conan he had moved onto slightly more serious acting roles in films like the terminator and commando only to make a mystifying return to the sword 'n sorcery genre for this 1985 debacle it 's hard to figure out why he bothered as this is weaker than both conan films in every conceivable department allegedly this was to have been the third conan film but for one reason or another the emphasis was shifted onto the leading female character the titular red-head leaving poor old arnold to play an incredibly dull supporting role spare a thought too for director richard fleischer who had given the world classics like 20,000 leagues under the sea fantastic voyage the boston strangler and 10 rillington place in this his penultimate film fleischer also has taken a gigantic career step backwards evil queen gedren sandahl bergman wants to rule the world and she needs a priceless and powerful talisman to do so she and her brutish army storm a keep populated by priestesses and steal the said talisman massacring the helpless priestesses as they go one of the dead priestesses has a sister named sonja brigitte nielsen a fiery red-headed warrior who upon hearing of her sister 's death swears revenge upon the evil gedren sonja rides across the land in search of gedren 's lair along the way she picks up travelling companions in the shape of a boy prince tarn ernie reyes jr and his bodyguard falkon paul smith she also meets the muscular warrior conan sorry i mean kalidor who offers to join her in her quest initially sonja does n't want the help of kalidor arnold schwarzenegger preferring instead to prove that she can confront and defeat her enemies alone but eventually she warms to him and accepts his assistance red sonja is a staggeringly poor film all the more so when one muses that it was made in 1985 when the sword 'n sorcery genre was close to its end it seems so simplistic and amateurish that one could easily mistake it for an early example of its kind the performances are poor on the whole ranging from bergman 's embarrassingly ott villain to reyes unbelievably irritating spoilt brat to schwarzenegger 's wooden and unenthusiastic hero nielsen is slightly better as the heroine presumably full of enthusiasm at the thought of being in her first starring role but she is let down very badly by the stupidity of clive exton and george macdonald fraser 's script the film is riddled with goofs including a scene where schwarzenegger is seen in close-up hacking down bad guys but in a long-shot in the same sequence there is n't a corpse in sight technically it is very inept too with sub-standard special effects and appallingly mechanical monsters there are a few compensations such as ennio morricone 's enjoyable music morricone spent a great deal of the '80s providing good music for awful films e.g the island treasure of the four crowns and hundra another compensation is giuseppe rotunno 's lensing of the locations in fact much of the time it 's a hell of a lot more gratifying to look at the lovely scenery than the actors standing in the foreground there were very few sword 'n sorcery films after red sonja so in some ways it might go down in history as the film which destroyed its own genre",0
i had borrowed the three sarah movies from a friend and had watched them while sick in bed during one weekend i thoroughly enjoyed every one of them i enjoyed how the last movie gave a glimpse of what caleb and his sister were like when they grew up in addition i liked the carry-through of the `` billy-boy '' song that first was heard during the credits of the first movie the title `` sarah plain and tall '' however the one thing in winter 's end that i did n't like was the youngest daughter she was a very cute little girl but she just had too much spirit and looked like a brat compared to the other kids even compared to talkative but still good-natured caleb when he was younger,1
it is to typical of people complaining about something when they no nothing about it ... so this is about a gay man falling for a straight women first of all ... this is a true story so you cant say its not believable second its written by a gay man so the whole thing about this being against the gays are just plain stupid personally i think this was the best love story i 've ever seen and i am very pro gay i think this shows that real love is about personality not just looks and sex and it has nothing against anyone who is gay straight or bi unlike so many other shows maybe we in europe take to it more cus most tv here are a bit deeper and make you think more then american tv ... plus we do n't fear when it comes to showing certain things if you want something funny with one of englands best lesley sharp and you want to see a decent believable love story without too much sap this is for you i know i love it,1
crackerjack starring mick malloy judith lucy both part of the cast in the early 90 's saturday night comedy show `` the late show '' bill hunter an australian movie icon and john clarke who we still see regularly on australian tv along side brian dawe crackerjack losely is about a guy in his early 30 's jack simpson played by mick malloy who pays his yearly memebership at the local bowls club in order to get a few car park spaces for which he uses himself and rents out to others as cheap inner city parking the club falls on hard times and pulls all the resources and memebers together it can jack gets a phone call telling him to turn up to next saturday 's bowls match or lose his membership and conseqently his car park space i wont spoil the rest but the film is funny light hearted and contains everything a good aussie film should if your not australian then some of the jokes and humour will no doubt baffle you if you are an aussie do yourself a favor and sit yourself down to crackerjack .. its now available on dvd i already have my copy 10/10 .. awesome flick,1
the emergence of quentin tarantino and his dubious influence on the likes of guy ritchie may have triggered the wave of appalling british gangster flicks we 've been bequeathed over the past few years but one of our most famous acting exports only serves to perpetuate the cycle by lending his considerable name to trash like this i only wish he 'd taken a moment to consider before choosing this project for the same reasons of personal gain he admits he often employs it 's not only stifling his talent but possibly the promise of future originality from british films not one of this film 's characters are likeable or even remotely realistic and the dialogue consists of the usual empty threats and colourful language caine does n't give the material any more effort than it deserves either if this was meant to be in the style of a tragic fall from grace a la `` king lear '' it would 've helped immensely had i cared about the ultimate fate of the principals instead of just wishing that they 'd get mired in the quicksand of life and dragged under almost immediately,0
really do n't care that no one on here likes this movie i do and that 's what this review is about lou diamond phillips is great in this comedic role that line about train a b and c is now to me an instant classic the cg is great yeah train looks a little fake but the aliens wow do they ever rock todd bridges where 's arnold and mr. drummond wow he 's been out of the loop guess that 's what jail does to you .. a bullet train is on it 's way to las vegas with the senator for him to deliver a big speech a meteor has just hit and now all of a sudden we got aliens running loose aboard the train and our hero cop has to save the day to make matters worse his ex-wife is on board arguing with him i just thought this movie was so wonderful a must see if you like action,1
this is an excruciatingly boring slow-moving movie we can feel some sympathy for the socially- and sexually-inexperienced and awkward tomek but the motivations of magda are pretty hard to see and the ending at least for me was inscrutable maybe it 's about how we all need love but i 'd get more out of a good busby berkeley i 'm told that comments have to be at least ten lines so i 'll add that in the background are some interesting shots of the relationship between polish citizens and government employees and institutions i wonder if it 's meant to portray this before or after the fall of the communist government finally watch for the clever way the men from the gas company investigate whether or not there is a gas leak in magda 's stove,0
audrey i know you truly cherish your husband ted 's memory but please do his legacy justice and heed his wishes dr. seuss refused to license his characters during his lifetime for a very good reason we beg of you to please stop cashing in on his stories images fantasies and characters they are getting disemboweled by the powers that be of hollywood and broadway the children of tomorrow will be stuck with these histrionic and grotesque interpretations that will forever pollute the loving warmth and innocence of his books it is indeed your property to do with as you wish i just wish you would listen to the advice of others for a little while save what is left of dr. seuss thank you,0
what a truly moronic movie all i can say is the writer must be very fond of magic mushrooms and lsd because this must be the result of one of his 'trips you follow the whole movie thinking alright this is very weird but hey i 'm sure at the end there will be a perfectly good explanation for all of this ... only to be disappointed to find erm no there 's no explanation at all and the twist at the end makes it even more confusing at the end of the movie you 'll probably have the same facial expression as if you were standing in a que paying for you groceries and the merchant told you that 'll be 11.95 please and proceeded to elbow you in the balls for no apparent reason there are so many factors in this movie that go unexplained and i think it leaves it to the imagination of the viewer in an entirely bizarre way do n't get me wrong i like weird movies 'the cell could easily be described as weird and twisted but in my eyes it 's a brilliant movie despite casting j-lo who i dislike to the maximum even that did n't manage to sway my opinion this is n't one of those movies and i think you should take in to consideration the characters of those who praise this movie i can tell you they are probably the sort of people that would go to an art exhibition see a splat of pigeon excrement on a white board and say `` oooooh what a masterpiece the artist has truly found a unique way to portray eternity '' when in actual fact all it is is bird excrement on a board keep that last bit in mind when watching this movie thanks for reading,0
this film has got so much in it prehistoric society adventure romance true brotherhood violence sex religion all depicted abundantly .. without a single word uttered and how come it sucks so bad this film will make you rethink the origin of humanity if this were the product of anthropology you would rather defy darwinian theory and hegelian synthesis all together you can not bear to watch this even with your brain shut down and now you are thinking `` i 've got to see this '' i warned you i take no responsibility whatsoever should you regret spending over an hour staring at this piece of art well i did warn you this should be forgotten and buried for ever,0
shemp finds out that he stands to inherit a million dollars if he is married within 24 hours considering how hideous he looks and his personality it is n't surprising that he ca n't get a taker -- that is until an article appears in the paper explaining his predicament -- at which point five crazed women appear from no where to claim their new hubby plus the money of course while i do n't hate the three stooges and like to watch their shorts on occasion they never even on their best day came close to the brilliant comedy of buster keaton that 's why i disliked this film as it was a ripoff of the plot from keaton 's masterpiece seven chances with the stooges it was n't uncommon for columbia pictures to steal old comedy plots or just recycle older stooge shorts so from the outset this film is a pale imitation of an original it 's also obvious that this film lacks the charm and subtlety of the original and the gags generally seem very forced paricularly the phone booth scene the cousin basil bit however was pretty cute and funny -- though far from subtle however the worst aspect of the film was the not particularly funny conclusion in the keaton version hundreds of women appeared to marry him and the action became very fast and furious -- here it all stayed in one small room and lacked comedic punch -- ending in a fizzle overall a dull retread also before marking this review `` not helpful '' be sure to first see seven chances to see what i am talking about -- then you decide,0
"is there any reason to revive characters 10 years after the fact when the only reason they worked the first time was due to the actors playing them who can replace jim carrey or cameron diaz -- or better yet who can replace them at cut-rate prices since most studios know that sequels do n't bring in the same amount of revenue as the originals so they cut corners from the get-go where are the good movies going to play if powerful hollywood studios can clog up 3,000 theaters opening weekend with whatever turds they feel like the general public can be suckered into enough 's enough people this sequel-itis has got to stop and the hollywood people need to start getting their act together or start distributing the much-better foreign product that 's floating in limbo wake up hollywood cause the people have woken up and they are n't buying it just cause it 's new and shiny give us the good stuff and send the rest to the dvd shelves cause we are taking back the theaters once and for all",0
this film did not excite me while on vacation in turkey i noticed that it was playing at the local cinema and decided to take the chance to go see it the action sequences in the film are well choreographed however the story drags during the middle of the film one thing that i did not quite follow is how borte was able to get the money to bribe the guards the other thing that i did not particularly like was the missing segment of khan 's life it did not go into detail as to how the bad guys were able to find him and re-imprison him after he had gone missing for so long overall i rate this movie a 4 because i enjoyed the action sequences but they were too few to justify a higher rating as the dialog left me less than impressed ...,0
i shall begin with a disclaimer this movie is not recommended for anyone who lack interest or have never played ff7 the game before watching the movie relies on the audience 's knowledge of each character in the game to convey story plot elements and it does so very subtly do your homework before watching this wonderful piece of cg film and i promise it 'll be that much better with that in mind this film has some of the most spectacular cg sequences i have ever witnessed the whole experience felt like an extra long fmv sequence from the game on steroids yeah the attention to detail in each scene especially in the heavy action oriented ones is so impeccable it left me with a sense of awe i believe the soundtrack is simplified so as to help the audience focus on the animation quality more than the music again for those who are familiar with the ff7 story and background the music should not surprise anyone although the timing and placement of each soundtrack from the original accompany each scene and mood to the point where the music simply enhances the animation once again i myself having only played through ff7 once thoroughly enjoyed this piece of art from square enix and that is the feel in most scenes choreographed and organized like a dance in short if you enjoyed the music or the game final fantasy 7 this film will blow you out of the water if you 're in the unfortunate majority who has not experienced the goodness known as ff7 on playstation or pc doing so before watching the movie will allow for an exponentially greater experience finally i just want to make a note of the quality in animating this film characters move with fluidity each scene background comes to life and tells its own story for those who criticize the thinness and dependency of the story plot i urge you to reexamine the animation facial reactions subtle clues that bring about another level of entertainment above the typical narration method of story plot delivery square enix and the great tetsuya nomura has set a new bar for quality animation and storytelling advent children has ushered in a new era for cg animations allowing the subtleties that lie in each character to speak volumes in and of themselves thanks square enix the wait was well worth it,1
let me clarify that this is not a `` good movie '' but i am so glad it is out there i am so glad i saw it and for the role that it plays in my dvd collection it is sublime it is the ultimate pg-13 romp it is college as we imagine it will be when we 're freshmen in high school it requires so much suspension of disbelief that it may as well be taking place on mars it is so wholesome that even when it tries to be dirty it would n't make your grandmother uncomfortable watching it requires so little sophistication in fact thinking too hard about what 's happening will get in the way of your appreciation of this work it makes me feel like i 'm 12 again and that kind of experience is worth more than 9.99,1
this might quite possibly be the worst movie i have ever seen i knew it was a b-movie before watching it it was actually the reason for watching it but i 'd never thought it could be this bad the title promises dracula in space and does deliver however the story makes no real use of the fact that casper van dien 's character is a descendant of van helsing and watch out for the ending of the movie it comes at you fast i 've never seen an ending scream out `` and now we 're over budget '' in a clearer fashion their resolution of the movie was rather comic though the story had so obviously painted itself into a corner if you feel you have to see it watch it with a friend who shares your love of b-movies if i had n't i would n't have made it to the end,0
nikki finn is the kind of girl i would marry never boring always thinking positively good with animals okay as one reviewer wrote a bit too much peroxide lipstick and eyebrows only madonna could get away with that but that 's why i love nikki finn she 's not your ordinary girl she makes things happen always exciting to be around and always honest sure she steals but she does n't rob or murder unless you 're out to do her in she knows which rules can be broken and which ones should be obeyed she knows what to take and what ca n't be stolen if you need a favor from her she 's in 100 bottom line she knows how to enjoy life nikki is always loving which is why she has a way with wild animals and completely dedicated to those she loves and who love her who 's that girl she 's the girl for me,1
`` one crazy summer '' is the funniest craziest not necessarily the best movie i have ever seen just when one crazy scene is done another emerges it never lets you rest just one thing after another the soundtrack is great the songs are the right ones for the scenes it is also a clean movie little that is dirty in it of course it has the story of the guys you would n't trust with your lunch money taking up a challenge and winning over people with more resources who 'd want to see it if they failed there is a serious side in that parents and children do not live up to each others dreams one should always have an open mind and weigh all the options this applies both to parents and children in `` one crazy summer '' the parents are wrong this is not always the case,1
i am surprised by the relatively low rating this film has it is a screwball comedy romance film rolled together by someone besides billy wilder but it does a really good job even won an oscar it is ingrid bergman 's first film in the us since the 1950 's even though she is no longer the young bombshell she was in her early films she brings off a difficult role quite handsomely this film proves she had multiple talents beyond her good looks goldie hawn who won an oscar in this her first film as supporting actress is very good as the modern sophisticated yet quirky latest mistress to dentist playboy love them leave them walter mathaw goldie is delightful to all the senses in this role which with a great cast set her up as a slam dunk for this early career award this film is not real deep but is a gem that has stood the test of time very well not sure why it 's average is so low as i give it a solid 8,1
i thought this movie was too absurd for me to finish watching it the premise was too silly and predictable i did n't make it far into the movie let me see she is obviously older than the cabbie unless she is a lot younger than she looks he is black and she is white she makes more money than him he is only a cabbie that 's 3 of society 's most statistically failed unions all rolled up in one and we are supposed to pretend they have a chance in hell she would be better off marrying the guy she does n't love i only watched it partially because i love mjw as an actor his acting was superb hers meh it was ok but the premise is too silly did n't see the end could n't make it there so i do n't know if it ended differently from the way i predicted the ending would be i ca n't imagine any black woman liking this movie there is something sickening about watching a black man catering to a white woman like that and an old one at that please not in the real world,0
since cats have nine lives i 'll give you nine reasons to see this movie the kittens berlioz and toulouse playing the piano together so unbelievably cute the car-chasing dogs napoleon and lafayette toulouse jumping like electrified every time he wants to be like a tough alley cat marie sighing romantically while alley cat o'malley seduces her mom scat cat and his jazz band singing `` ev'rybody wants to be a cat '' stupid but proper and nice english geese amelia and abigail who make the cats walk like geese o'malley obtaining the `` magic carpet '' which puts the cheshire cat to shame roquefort the brave mouse 's journey to ask help from alley cats edgar the butler chase scenes and transition from a nice guy to an insane cat hater due to cat riddance plan gone bad,1
i really thought this would be a good movie boy ... was i mistaken for a quick summery b grade acting c grade special effects d grade for the overall movie do n't get me wrong the story was pretty good and not kiddish so an adult too ride along with it the `` hero '' is good looking so most women will like it not a total chick flick as it contains some fight scenes and some blood but the way it is shot ... horrible the special effects- would be better suited for tv- on a kids show and lastly ... send some of the actors back to acting school if they ever attended a class there trust me there are much better ways to waste 2 hours you have been warned,0
nice movie and nicholle tom does a fantastic job playing the `` guy in the girl 's body '' she really does it well a sort of teen version of many other movies but well done well casted from `` matt '' to `` matt2 '',0
this is the second hitchcock film to appear on the list and the second hitchcock film i 've seen in full the first was rope which i really enjoyed with saboteur hitchcock was more room to roam free whereas rope took place all in one room i did n't enjoy this one as much as rope but that 's not saying this is a bad film it just seems like an average flick that could have been something more it seems like a film hitchcock would make as a break in between his more serious ones as a thriller i feel it fails to really get my on the edge of my seat or engaged with the lead character who is running around the states the climax of the film feels like a miss opportunity to really amp up the tension the sound design is almost non existent you can hear their dialogue and a bit of the environment around them but the important things are missing the stitches ripping apart from the sleeve the need of music to amp of the tension all missing intentional no doubt yet it lacks the emotional punch one would want from such a scene then it ends abruptly leaving you empty inside the film does n't feel like it should either they are almost globe trotting from place to place yet it feels more confined the script itself is very average and seems to go about the more obtuse ways to get the plot moving the performances are there but nothing amazing everyone plays their parts to scripted words on the page the relationship between the two leads is weak and needed more work the one stand out is otto kruger who has that rich ego evil persona down pat in the end i wanted more from this one i understand it 's one of hitchcock 's least exciting films but i did have a good time watching it i can recommend it just not enthusiastically,1
this movie moved me more than i was expecting and i was fully prepared to cry the acting mainly carried this film with superb performances from jude law nicole kidman and renee zellweger as well as the supporting cast these actors portrayed characters so intensely human that they lingered the remainder of the night with me and i had trouble shaking this war drama the costumes and cinematography were also magical but did n't get carried away with themselves they did n't take focus but added to the whole effect cold mountain could never become my favorite movie as that title will always belong to the english patient but it 's in the top five the story itself was well developed and stayed fairly unpredictable i did not find myself guessing what line came next a heart-wrenching story about humanity and war in fact this movie was so strongly real that it was barely noticeable it took place in the 19th century it seemed to apply to all times,1
a twist of fate puts a black man at the head of an old-school white-bred advertising firm and he intends to make a few changes ... one very strange piece of cinema you 'll either love it or hate it either way you 've never seen anything like it,1
if you find the depiction of violent murders and wanton police brutality expressed in a plot less film with glacial pacing entertaining then you 're bound to enjoy surveillance this film was garbage for both the mind and spirit the notion that this is a `` thriller '' is comical that would imply some kind of tension and twists you kept waiting for the story to actually finish `` starting '' it never rises above a glorification of weak-minded violent criminals and individuals from all walks of life picture all of the violence of `` no country for old men '' without any kind of chase or sympathetic characters thrill-killers run amok the acting is good mostly but the script is a pile do n't bother and tell your friends to do n't bother,0
not really all that much to this movie ... either a stunt racer or a stock car racer has a flaming car in the beginning of the movie goes to bar is approached by a biker gang who ruins his chances with a very lovely lady offer him a job he goes back to their place refuses the police ask him to accept their ya go what plays out is a very annoying little film that sees the hero not really do all that much and a biker gang that can kill and for some reason the police can not pin a crime on them i am not sure why the female biker did what she did at the end but hey it is a bad movie you always get scenes that make little sense i am still trying to figure out if i misheard it when they said the hero of the piece was a stunt car driver they may have said stock car driver because why would a stunt racer be racing and i would n't think it would be all that uncommon for a stunt car to crash the actors are bad and all the bikers are pretty annoying and the hero is kind of incompetent ... really this movie is not full of kicks but it is the pits,0
i wasn t expecting much with harlem nights but i wasn t expecting it to be as bad as it was without doubt the worst aspect is the obscene language it really is awful the amount there is in this film and before anyone accuses me of being a wimp let me point out two things ... 1 amongst my fave films i would include goodfellahs platoon raging bull while my favourite movie of all time is apocalypse now 2 my all time favourite american television show is the hbo prison drama oz so you see films and television shows with massive amounts of swearing don t normally bother me but the problem i had with harlem nights is to do with the fact it s supposed to be a comedy but it seems the production team came to the conclusion that an audience laugh everytime someone especially if that someone is black says a rude word and decided to subsitute funny situations with swearing all the way through the film hoping to get a laugh well i thought i d never start laughing and i didn t,0
i think that this is a fabulous movie ... i watched it constantly from the time i was 4 to about the time i was 8 ... however watching it resulted in many nightmares i particularly got them because of the guy that was always like `` the otherworld '' and his friends i am 12 and i still get nightmares about it to this day i ca n't fall asleep right now because i am thinking about it i love this movie but it is so scary i definitely love this movie though i have very good memories from it kate is very good at acting in this movie amazingly i never realized that it was her i also think that the graphics were very high quality contrary to what some other people think,1
although flatliners is 15 years old tonight was my first time ever seeing it i had heard about the movie flatliners but there was never a buzz about it to make me go out and rent it or make a point to see it period well i caught it on one of the premium channels and i must say that it was very good this movie was about some brilliant young medical students deciding to explore death they have figured out a way to cause a person to die briefly and bring him/her back to life besides the all-star cast this movie had some serious bite to it just the very thought of exploring death is riveting enough but i really thought the writer director did an excellent job in giving a different yet hair raising view this was no generic attempt to thrill frighten and make one 's mind race ... this was the real deal instead of making it an empty superficial star-studded thriller this movie had substance a nail-biter white knuckle edge-of-the-seat hard nose thriller i give it an 8/10,1
jane eyre with full frontal nudity i was not surprised to see that a woman had had a hand in this awful `` woman 's picture '' and i mean that in the worst possible way the trouble is it could have been so good if they had only left out the jane eyre stuff and stuck with the vastly more interesting scenes involving the spanish/portuguese jews in early 19th century london when the sound track music is better than the film you know you are in trouble when you fast forward the video because you ca n't stand the film just to make sure you do n't miss anything you are in even worse trouble this film will end up on the romance tv channel where it rightly belongs,0
flatliners left quite a noticeable impression in my head the story is quick paced and leaves you constantly absorbed and at many times quite tense its about five remarkable student doctors notably julia roberts and kevin bacon among whom one of them has devised the mechanism of remaining dead or getting flat-lined for a few seconds and then coming back to life the procedure is quite 'complex involving a plethora of medical knick-knacks injections electric blankets oxygen masks and a variety of esoteric medical terms i strongly suspect doctors coined all these words so that they never need to get layed off but funnily they follow the kiss original version for engineers keep it simple stupid extended version for doctors keep it stupid simple philosophy as well at the risk of getting euthanized by some revenge-taking doctor reader let me continue so the first guy who gets flat-lined hopes to find the answers to life which philosophy and religion can not convincingly answer he hopes to get it answered and become famous through applied science he flat-lines for around two minutes and then comes back into our world left quite shaken during death he has a vision of an incident when he was young which left the strongest impression on his life he killed another boy when he was kid by accident and he still feels responsible for it with the success of the first flat-liner the others follow suit each of them extending their flat-line time further and further to test the limits of how long one can remain dead and experience life after death meanwhile monsters from the past and future keep coming back to haunt them after their flat-line experience the first flat-liner is haunted by a young kid who tortures him when he is alone the second who camera-ed all the women he took to bed sees television sets all over playing his videos the third is haunted by a young girl who he teased in school the fourth is haunted by her suicide-dead father for whom she feels responsible all of them are driven insane by these haunting and obsessions and think that the past seems to want to take revenge on them the main focus on getting flat-lined is that your entire life passes through your eyes at the moment of 'dying whatever stage that is and you are left mostly with the strongest impressions of life in your mind since they did n't die these strong impressions have somehow resurfaced and have become the focus of their lives all of them somehow come to terms with and extinguish their past demons all of them except the first one who realizes the only way he can move on through life is getting flat-lined again during this flat-line session he sees himself getting flat-lined the first time and also sees the boy he killed trying to kill him this time round the boy kills him this time for a few minutes and in doing so has sought revenge for a few minutes in the movie one is left wondering if he gets to come back thankfully because most of us like happy endings the boy absolves him of his past and he comes back to life again,1
hollywood movie industry is the laziest one in the entire world it only needs a single hit to flood theaters with the same old crap re-invented over and over again take superheroes for example for each x-man and spiderman there are daredevil elektra ghost rider and hulk japanese horror remakes are even worst it only took the ring which was pitch-perfect mostly because of mr. gore verbinsky to bring a ton of look-alike creepy-woman based horrors e.g the ring 2 the eye dark water which was fine but pointless and the grudges the first grudge was n't entirely bad it was scary most of the way which is what one could expect from it plus the plot had some brains mixing narratives grudge 2 is exactly like the previous this could be a good thing but hey what boy men in black ii was it a nice thing to xerox the entire screenplay and just change the villain for the grudge 2 the critic goes the same way tired scares bad acting except for amber tamblyn and clichés all over the place three stories take place on different places and time there is aubrey tamblyn investigating what drove her sister karen sarah michelle gellar to death allison arielle kebbel who is taken by colleagues to visit the house where the incident depicted in the first movie took place and finally an american family that witness strange stuff happening on the apartment next door glad to say and i mean it that everything is tied up at the end but one must not rely on the end to make a good picture when everything else is simply tiresome and dull the chills are all over there a girl alone in the lockers someone who should n't enter a house others that dig too deep meanwhile ghosts keep killing and killing and killing which seems even more deadlier than ten world wars or the ebola epidemic hey does n't that seem just like another bad japanese remake something called pulse yeah day after day it 's getting easier to hold a grudge ... against hollywood bullshits,0
why is impossible to write in french very kitch this journey in the center of the earth is despicable technical possibilities nevertheless current in 1976. these big `` casimir '' of monsters is completely ridiculous the film deserve however a `` remake '' as was `` king kong '' the last one with a little more supplied scenario the professor has resemblances with the professor calculus and is rather funny david the character is enough inconsistent but cross spend to the people from below a good message `` you unite and will overcome you `` altogether we would say a film made in the 40s now that i said everything or almost the evil of which i thought of it we can say that if we have the brain get tired or anything has to see of the other one then the thing matter is even rather entertaining hugh such is my opinion translating french to english with `` reverso '' sorry for possible mistakes,0
i loved this movie and i never knew it was this old it came out the day n year i was born in and now i am 19 now i still love this movie especially the songs like `` my mother '' and `` boys and girls of rock n roll '' and i remember as a kid i believe i was 5 n my sister was 6 and my cousin boy was 6 as well we used to pretend to be the characters in the movie i was eloner and janette and my sister was britany and my cousin was alvin simon and theodore those were good times and i miss it and having this movie reminds me of the good times since my cousin is old for this stuff and so am i and my sis we are not going to forget about the chipmunk and the chipmunk movie i still even remember the songs and the words off by heart even though i have n't seen this movie for 12 years but now starting to love it again alvin and the chipmunks and chipettes 3 3 3 3,1
this is absolutely awful it 's everywhere nowhere does n't have any sort of point i have never understood what is good about jeff garlin or sarah silverman bonnie hunt is so above this drivel she must have been personal friends w/people involved because there is no way she would have read any part of this so-called `` script '' thought `` yeah i wan na do that '' most movies i can find at least one or two things that are redeemable or funny there is zero of that in this it 's extremely dumb there really is n't any other word to describe this this is quite possibly the biggest waste of money on making of film that i have seen in a long time skip this at all cost you 'll be glad you did,0
i managed to see the mtv premiere of this movie last night and i needed to tell everyone that this movie brought the thunder obviously this movie will be most enjoyed by fans of the d as it has plenty of in-jokes for those that have seen the hbo series and has more than enough d for newer fans and the mass of soon-to-be converts the music really shines with the new songs `` kickapoo '' which is much better than it sounds `` master exploder '' possibly the 3rd best song in the world and `` dude i totally miss you '' there are a load of excellent scenes the car chase the rock-off the meeting and cameos including dave grohl as satan i really could go on for hours but i do n't want to give the movie away go see it you wo n't be disappointed,1

... a film comes along that manages to be absolutely terrible from the opening titles on through to the studio logo tagged at the end of the closing credits this was such a film the very type you can not stop watching for fear of missing a moment of its ever-descending quality forget the low budget that 's indicated by a slow monotonous opening sequence that shows secret service agents running alongside a presidential motorcade with no crowds no traffic or location discernible forget the jumbled logic needed to even remotely make the actual plot seem plausible forget that roy scheider delivers some of the hammiest dialogue whilst completely failing to hide his shame this clunker is terribly paced bombarded by a score that 's simply laughable and seems edited by a third grader all the while twisting scenarios to cover up the hardest thing about filming a presidential storyline on the cheap making him seem presidential i honestly feel asleep briefly in the last reel and when i awoke i ran it back so as not to miss a single excruciating frame try this drinking game take a shot every time you see it blatantly aping another much better film you 'll doze off too not since 'the man w/ samuel l. jackson and eugene levy have i seen such a delightfully unredeemable project i may give out copies as christmas gifts zero stars a thousand laughs,0
a real hoot unintentionally sidney portier 's character is so sweet and lovable you want to smack him nothing about this movie rings true and it 's boring to boot,0
early jackie chan film where there is no sign of the chan persona we know this is chan in a full on traditional revenge tale of the sort that was cloned and re-cloned by countless producers and studios all through hong kong taiwan and mainland china its a very serious story that shows none of the humor and warmth that would catapult jackie chan to super stardom its also clear from watching this that had he not reinvented himself odds are we would never have known him because his career would have been painfully short as a film on its own merits this is a good looking but pretty unremarkable movie i was watching it in the midst of an all day marathon of martial arts films and it would have blended together with every other film that i watched that day had i not noticed jackie in the film honestly i do n't think the film is really worth bothering with there are too many other better variations except if you 're interested in seeing where jackie chan started,0
thirty pieces of silver and a kiss for luck this one was another totally unexpected gem usually i 'm not even a suspense/thriller fan this satisfying 100 minutes has more twists than a boardwalk pretzel it has titillating erotic romance reminiscent of `` body heat '' in more ways than one it has cops and crime political intrigue and just a dash of daytime soap it has just the right touch of gritty violence that any professional `` by-the-numbers '' crime job must employ emma thompson fbi aic delivers her role with grace and humor and gets my vote for best fake southern accent by a limey alan rickman local cop who always seems to steal the show is excellent but not overbearing they work well as a pair lots of plot misdirection that never gets out of control and gets coherently reconnected at film 's end and who is this awesome woman carla gugino i want her to bear my children carla if you 're out there let 's do lunch,1
one of the commentators on the subject of lil pimp dbborroughs of glen cove got it right when he/she stated that the movie is really bad but i take exception when he/she commented on the animation the animation was n't bad because of macromedia flash it was bad animation because it was directed wrong flash is just a tool in the right hands an artist can create animation as full and fluid as any disney film and in the wrong hands it can look as bad as the stuff on the internet which is where lil pimp originated and should 've stayed there studios such as cartoon network nickelodeon disney and warner bros. create wonderful animation using flash i.e. puffy ami yumi foster 's home for imaginary friends mucha lucha etc. lil pimp was an ill conceived piece of tripe that was made because revolution studios bought media tripp and lil pimp was one of the properties included roth and company thought they 'd make a quick buck exploiting a turd like lil pimp and the sham was perpetuated by it 's producer amy pell the reason for this third trimester abortion of an animated film is that none of the executives at revolution studios had the pragmatic brains to sideline mark brooks and peter gilstrap they really tried their best but were way in over their heads and hire real writers directors and at least a semi-competent producer they did one thing correctly though they hired some of the best storyboarders designers and animators in la but as lil pimp demonstrates one can buy the best sports car on the floor but if you 're a moron you 'll wreck it for sure,0
homecoming what a huge disappointment after reading the plot summary the dead coming back to vote against george w bush i could n't wait to see this it started off interesting and it immediately caught my attention unfortunately though it slowly descended into a boring political satire that i did n't need to see i can just watch some good old aussie comedy for that there was pretty much only one or two scenes of horror and they were n't even that scary i could n't believe this came from joe dante who could easily have pulled it off with an equal balance of thrills and satire the worst episode so far 2/5,0
mom should really be given a different title to distinguish it from all the other movies out there called mom or with the word mom in the title this is a vastly superior zombie movie to so much of the rubbish that gets churned out time after time and all end up much the same as every other zombie movie out there it is so different and refreshing it almost defies categorisation the kind old lady who takes in a creepy lodger who just happens to be a flesh eater who then infects the old lady who also turns into a flesh eating zombie or ghoul quite which exactly is not defined there is pathos in the story as her son realises what she has become and while at first horrified attempts to help her by supplying 'food i shall say no more about that for fear of inserting a spoiler it is one of those 'quiet movies as opposed to guns blasting explosions raging car chases etc boring etc that makes so many movies all the same rubbish but still with enough gory moments to satisfy horror fans whilst also inserting sadness into the story along with nice touches of humour as opposed to downright silliness of some so-called 'horror movies there is a particularly nice atmospheric shot at the beginning of the film where the old lady is sitting alone in her room with only her christmas tree for company and looks so 'innocent but what she becomes oh my a gem of a movie and even if not your thing should at least be viewed if only once by any true horror fan,1
`` tipping the velvet '' is one of the modern day television productions that prove that some television can be just as good or even better as this is than what you see at your local theater if you want to read the plot read this and if you want other details skip down to the next paragraph this is the unforgettable portrait of an unconventional young girl named nan who works as a naive oyster girl until she discovers her repressed homosexuality when she falls in love with a successful woman named kitty who dresses as a male for her stage profession the young girl soon joins the act as another male impersonator and they are a major hit soon the both of them embark on a tender affair kitty eventually becomes enveloped in a marriage of convenience and ravages young nan 's heart from then on nan works as male impersonated prostitute to men looking to have sex with boys then she becomes the private sex slave to the evil and sadomasochistic diana where nan experiences severe emotional abuse when that ends badly nan is on the streets again where she recalls a young woman named florence a good-hearted socialist who had the true potential of being a wonderful partner that 's where nan will discover the power of socialism and learn how to get back to fame the region 1 transfer is of exceptional picture quality there is a very good scene selection an eloquent photo gallery and a fun interview between novelist sara waters and the film 's writer andrew davies the sets costumes cinematography and music are gorgeous the acting writing and directing are extremely strong and filled with realism class and originality i loved the film and the novel section iii in the film is much different in the film than in the novel because section iii in the novel is great written down but is n't screen material i will be brave and say that i love the films interpretation of it much more this breathtaking historical ingeniously combines drama comedy erotica and romance to vibrant perfection in a way that is both deeply moving and spiritually uplifting for every mature and open-minded adult who has ever felt the pleasures pains and power of falling in love and living life to it 's fullest a revolutionary production an absolute must-see,1
i am looking at all the good reviews about this film and i start thinking to myself ... am i going crazy .. ca n't i see the beauty from a film like this .. am i just dumb enough to not understand the message this film is trying to point out i do n't know .. maybe one of those lizards entered in my head and ate all my brains as well the film idea was going nowhere ... i was sure it would have a foggy end and of course ... it did nothing exceptional ... not even the landscapes i hopped that being placed in a mountain village at least the landscapes would be nice .. but no just a lame story about a crazy teacher and of course her crazy students ... now all grown up each of them .. with his/her own fixed ideas and boy some of those ideas were stupid .. like the lizard story for example at a moment i thought i was watching x files .. with the lizard entering in the ear and all no .. from my point of view this movie is a waste of time not to say money if u pay for the ticket the only part that i did like was the acting of the young blue eye `` german '' kid ... he played very well and convincing for his age ... the rest ... nothing i read the previous review and i think the script writer and the director were both on drugs when they came up with those ideas well considering that there are a lot of people that enjoyed this film ... i think to myself again .. maybe i am the crazy one advice .. do n't waste your time with this,0
i do n't care if some people voted this movie to be bad if you want the truth this is a very good movie it has every thing a movie should have you really should get this one,1
terry benedict andy garcia catches up with danny ocean and his team and demands that they repay the money that they stole from him in oceans 11 plus interest he holds back from violent action however as he is under the instruction of the world 's greatest thief the night fox the team then have to pull off a series of heists to pay benedict back whilst testing their abilities against the night fox who wishes to maintain his position as the greatest thief ever put simply this film is a complete mess the masses may argue that it is `` cool '' and that clooney and pitt put in great performances but these are the same people who have a subscription to `` hello '' magazine and think that david beckham has the potential to be a great actor the story is convoluted it is not complex or clever and it does not have intelligent twists and turns it is just a complete mess that spills out in multiple directions with the hope that the audience will think it is cool and intelligent hello magazine readers any respectable movie watcher will however see the film for the farce that it is whilst oceans 11 was n't a great film it had a decent pace was stylish and had some decent twists and turns this movie loses its way very quickly and then basically gives up it is as if the director and cast said to themselves hey this is n't really working out lets just have a laugh indeed the cast looks like they are enjoying themselves but i was not i will not delve into the plot as its confused evolution does not warrant any examination the addition of catherine zeta jones is largely annoying the scenes where julia roberts impersonates herself with bruce willis undertaking a cameo role whilst mildly amusing appear to be a desperate move to keep the audience interested the movie is so full of plot holes that it as if arnie has emptied an uzi 9mm into the film studio credit can only be given to some scenes where the night fox uses caopeira to undertake a heist against the back drop of some funky music but this is hardly justification to watch the movie the final scene features the team in a nonsensical drunken stupor this accurately sums up the movie stick with the original,0
this is a pretty simplistic romance girl finds boy girl loves boy girl loses boy girl finds boy colleen moore is the outstanding ingredient in this recipe delivering a wonderfully varied dramatic/romantic performance well deserving of an oscar nom equally fine are the aerial combat special effects moore plays a french girl whose mother has turned over their field to a british aerial squadron during wwi she is the `` daughter of the regiment '' loved as a little sister into this mix comes a fill-in for a downed flyer gary cooper at first they hate each other then they love each other then the entire squadron is sent out on a suicide mission cooper returns but crashes in the village and a red cross unit removes him moore searches for him is told at a hospital he is dead then wanders the streets until he calls from a hospital window and they are reunited it 's a nice little romance but hardly more than that recommended for fans of ms. moore and mr. cooper,0
the duo of abbott and costello lives on in this version of a story-time classic in `` jack and the beanstalk '' there 's everything to see music magic and comedy rolled into one costello play plays jack after he listens to the story being told by a young boy one time we know jack was a poor boy who sells his cow `` dolly '' for 5 magic beans well he plants those 5 beans and they were indeed magic he climbs to the sky sees a big castle there and he would sing a song unknown he would encounter the giant buddy baer not only him he would dance with the woman who was also a giant she would clobber jack with her elbows during the dance that was funny you got the playing harp who knows how to put the giant as ease the goose who lays golden eggs and my favorite the way jack gets rid of the giant he gets the ax and started chopping down on the beanstalk another funny is where the ax got stuck during the chop and the final celebration happens when the people dance around the imprint where the giant fell a lot of fun and fun for the whole family as well very recommended 5 stars,1
about your terrible movie copying beethoven as a professional musician it 's my duty to watch every movie made about any composer and beethoven is one of my favorites when hungarians and americans meet it 's a terrible combination of empty over the top emotions combined with the worst taste possible you proved it in your terrible b-movie the only thing that carries the movie is the music of course you did n't bother to look further than the good but in my taste contrived performances of the tackacs quartet but ok i have to admit that the performances at least have quality as contrast to the movie you 've made it starts of with the dying deaf beethoven who perfectly understands anna who is merely whispering beethoven 's hearing during the movie get 's better by the minute but that must be because of some vague divine thing then there is the quite impossible semi-pornographic `` eyes wide shut '' double-conducting scene which is totally over the top with the luscious anna and the crying nephew in the end who also cries in the deleted scenes with constant red eyes my god what a performance and as culmination the rip-off from amadeus with beethoven dictating music to anna not in notes but in total nonsense which she understands perfectly but no-one else in your audience even trained professional musicians will understand of course your reaction will be that negative response is a response at least but i can assure you that beethoven himself is turning in his grave because of your worthless creation and with reason this so called homage is blasphemy and i am so sorry to have rented one of the worst movies ever made even though it 's about my favorite subject ed harris and others you can not comprehend the greatness of beethoven in your wildest dreams and certainly not after a couple of lessons in conducting and violin playing that 's the trouble with you americans you think you can grasp everything even when it takes a lifetime of hard work yeah we can do it anyway remember that a good product comes with hard labor talent devotion and professionalism all these you creators of copying beethoven lack see you in kindergarten,0
at least it is with this episode here we have a time traveler the professor from gilligan 's island no less going back in time to 1865. what does one do -- why try to save lincoln of course no really interesting variations are rung on this old theme as another reviewer has stated this episode is particularly drab and unstylish with little to suggest that `` the professor '' really is back in the 1860s budget limitations are readily apparent and the direction is stolid john wilkes booth adds a spark but it remains a very flat production we too often feel we are on stage sets waiting for something clever to happen there is a minor twist at the end but i emphasize minor,0
well sword in the moon finally got a dvd release in korea and despite the mostly negative responses i 've heard to it and the suspiciously tardy dvd release i could n't help but pick it up any wu xia film is better than most non-wu xia films in my eyes d perhaps low expectations were an advantage because i was quite pleasantly surprised to find the film pretty enjoyable an assassin is killing a number of ministers who were involved in a revolution that usurped the throne and the government 's top swordsman is tasked with identifying the culprit this does n't take particularly long but the answer is not one he wanted to hear through prolonged flashbacks we learn why and the history of the swordsman and the assassin and of the revolution the film is typically melodramatic for a korean film and resolutely serious in tone no hk style comedy moments to be found here the story can be a little difficult to follow at first but all makes sense eventually the film goes a bit wobbly at the end but no worse than a chang cheh film might do and for the most part i found it enjoyable the production values are high with some good cinematography to capture it the fight scenes are n't up to the calibre of the better hk wu xia films but perhaps they 're not meant to be the fights are more `` realistic '' in that they 're less like choreographed dance routines but there 's some wirework and occasional cgi that put the film in `` wu xia '' mode the film does n't have the best cast unfortunately with the leads being a tad lacking in charm and occasionally difficult to distinguish from each other there 's a young lady in the film that i do n't think i 've seen before but makes the best impression of any of the principle cast not just because you see her nekkid ... or perhaps it is p the film lacks the charm and grace of the better hk wu xia films and perhaps the beauty too but i only wish hk would make them half this good anymore twins effect 2 does not give me hope that that 's about to happen any time soon though tsui hark surely still has it in him if he can get the funding and cast sword in the moon is not going to go onto my list of favourite wu xia by any means but it 's a whole heap better than romantic warriors or legend of the evil lake perhaps better than bichunmoo too though i did like that film quite a bit more on a second viewing obviously it 's nowhere near the wonderful musa but it 's a different affair altogether really sitm will probably get a second viewing within three years which is perhaps the best indicator of how much i liked it 7/10,1
i just picked this up in a decent if not outstanding dvd version for one dollar at wal mart run out and buy it i 'm fairly sure that this version is the short incomplete version released against the animator 's wishes in the late fifties but even so at a buck it 's an incredible bargain this film was syndicated in small chunks as a serial to local tv stations in the early 60s for the kid 's shows that almost every station ran on weekday afternoons in those days `` mr bill and bozo '' `` monty 's gang '' channel 4 greenville sc and `` captain grady '' channel 13 asheville nc which is where i saw it it made such an impression on twelve-or-so-old me that i immediately recognised it when i spotted it in wal mart tonight and grabbed it wonderful you should get it,1
taylor hackford wanted to make this movie for 15 years and finally found jamie foxx to play the title role foxx is amazing in his portrayal of ray charles from an interview i saw with foxx he met charles several times and the two of them also played piano together foxx had piano lessons as a young child and actually played piano in all his scenes i did n't see charles live until his later years so it was great to get a perspective on how his career developed i hope foxx gets nominated for the best actor oscar as he certainly deserves it the music also is incredible it really showcases the breadth of charles music from country to blues and everything in between the movie also gives an unblemished account of ray charles life from the many women he had relationships with to his drug habit and the consequences of that,1
i walked into a book store in brentwood tennessee i am not going to say the name because i am a dedicated customer i have been satisfied with every item i purchased there before this one on display in the front of the store was the bell witch haunting might i mention this is the only store i have seen it for sale in i had heard about the story somewhere and remembered it was supposed to have really happened for real i was very excited and could n't wait to watch it i had great expectations for it i could n't believe what i seen when i viewed it it did n't look like a real movie it looked like a home video i was under the impression it was suppose to be a horror movie i mean the movie was suppose to be about a witch haunting you know this is no horror movie you will not jump out of your seat watching this movie i gave the movie all the chances in the world to get better as it went along i swear i did it never did get any better there were several scenes of this little kid getting poop and pee thrown on him i did n't find that entertaining at all i watched the whole movie with disbelief that the store would actually sell this to me i guess that is how bad this economy has got i have this to say to the cast and crew do not show this film as material to get other film jobs do n't do it i mean that sincerely i commend you for trying for people who have bought this i say this do n't sell your copy to someone they could get very upset have a nice day everyone,0
i gave this movie a 10 simply out of my sick obsession with ingrid bergman lol i really think she was the best actress to ever grace this earth with her talent and all of her movies are absolutely wonderful even when they are awful because she is in them if it had n't been her and vivien leigh as it had originally been desired i hear i would have given it a 9.0 simply because i love viv but probably not as much as i love ingrid and any other actress would have made it maybe a 6. it 's a good story two wild people falling in love in a society where it bad to be bad reminds me a little of gwtw except laced with a more highbrow attitude gary cooper is very handsome as usual and of course his voice never changes the entire film but hey ingrid makes him seem so amazing and dashing and 20 times hotter than he probably should be,1
i did n't hate this one i just could n't adapt to the story it did n't really grab me michael mann is a very good director but i have to disagree with his methods in this i 'm also a fan of daniel day lewis some projects he 's been in are pretty rubbish but his acting is brilliant my favourite daniel day lewis films are there will be blood and gangs of new york there is one thing i loved about this and that was the musical score it gave the film a lot of atmosphere thats about all i liked in it though this film has a high vote as well which is a bit random i can see that a fair few people will like this but not enough to make the overall rating 7.8. i would give this film a miss if i was you but there is a lot of high votes for this so i guess you should watch it and make your own views on what you think i did n't really like it ............. 4/10 ............. j.d seaton,0
i went to see this thinking it would be a great comedy and a comeback for robin williams but when i saw it i realized i had bee lied to by advertisers as this is more drama than comedy although it has a few really good laughs in it it felt like i was watching two movies one was a funny romp with robin williams that should have been the whole basin for the movie anyway but you also get a techno thriller movie with political angst in the middle i really do n't know how to classify this film but i can tell you it was good and i did laugh not as much as i had hoped but at least williams is back in the right direction see this but know before going it is not all comedy and is a little intense,1
it has been almost 50 years since i saw `` jennifer '' for the first and only time i did not know the name of this movie until i looked it up on this web site but i have told many people especially my grandchildren how movies do not have to include graphic details in order to frighten you and leave powerful impact the story skillfully introduces you to concepts which if true put ida lupino in a very dangerous situation each time miss lupino discovers a new `` fact '' she draws the viewer into her confusion and fear this movie has such impact on me that almost 50 years later i still list it as one of the most frightening movies that i have ever seen yet this movie does not contain the blood and gore which became popular shortly after this movie was made it 's amazing what impact a good story and great actors can make,1
while the camerawork was certainly `` funky '' perhaps one dutch-roll short of `` stoned '' the premise of the film was fantastic it really took a scathingly satirical in the true traditional of hal hartley look at god jesus and devil the interaction of jesus and satan provides some hilarious scenes ... even the monologues of jesus were great this was by far the best jesus i 've even seen so laidback zen-like son-of-god-ish but still such a nice guy on one level this is a very general look on the paradoxes of christianity but yet there is still a personal level where you can relate to jesus christ without having a god-complex thanx to martin donovan and hal hartley,1
this review is in response to the submission wondering how factually correct the movie was ... saw this movie last year and found it inspiring that hopeful immigrants like my italian grandparents who came through ellis island at the turn of the last century would subject themselves to all manner of invasive inspection just to enter america it was certainly eye opening since my grandparents never spoke of anything terrible while there my grandmother was 5-years old and my grandfather 18 when they arrived i just returned from a trip to new york where i had the pleasure of visiting ellis island and the museum actually walks you through the immigration evaluation process the filmmaker obviously did his research right down to the medical exams and equipment questions and puzzles they are all there at the museum even the wedding pictures and the review board room -- factually correct anyone who has immigrant grandparents should see this movie inspirational to say the least,1
altman and scorsese have twisted sex together in one of the greatest american films of the past 20 years boogie nights did n't make a huge initial splash and i still do n't think it 's received the credit it deserves the immediate clamor surrounding the film `` some porn movie with marky mark '' was wholly without merit what paul thomas anderson has created is no less than a stunning representation of the pursuit and subsequent loss of the american dream if such a thing still exists for those of you who have been living in a box or a confessional for the past 8 years boogie nights tells the literal rise-and-fall tale of young eddie adams wahlberg eddie is just a dopey kid from torrance california who wants something more out of life his room is soaked in muscle-bound naive americana his dreams are far bigger than his potential but not quite as large as his ... special gift his bald-headed southern gent quickly raises the attention and eyebrows of the booming omni-present adult film industry jack horner burt reynolds as the film 's twinkle-eyed papa bear gets wind of eddie 's hidden talent and decides to put him in a movie before you can say `` deep-throat '' eddie has changed his name to dirk diggler and exposed his massive member to a wide-eyed public fame and fortune make dirk 's acquaintance as do a bevy of local porn celebs his friends and co-workers become his makeshift family but it soon proves to be a sunday picnic like no other as the feel-good 70s give way to the coke-addled video-friendly 80s dirk co. begin a dangerous backslide anderson put everything he had into this glorious moving epic it sizzles and never fizzles nary a frame of this monumental picture is wasted and the characters and their dialogue live with us long after elo fades from the soundtrack see this one immediately and then watch it again and again,1
hey there army sgt i 'm sorry dude but being a sgt in the army and being in the army national guard does not make you qualified to comment on a marine movie you are not a marine and just because you wear a uniform does n't mean you can relate to being a marine we simply are the best we have the hardest training yes we have big heads about ourselves but hey when you are the best you like to strut your stuff i was in the iraq invasion and in fallujah i fought next to soldiers you are not `` qualified '' to say anything about my marine corps i hate to be the one that starts the whole `` which branch is better '' but you have no right to say you are qualified to judge a marine movie oh yeah ...... we are drill instructors ....... not drill sgt 's that 's the biggest clue you have no idea about what you are talking about yeah we do not `` curse '' at recruits anymore tell me how is cussing at someone going to make them a better marine how will me hitting someone make a marine a better marine yes it is a kinder boot camp from what i went through but we are dealing with different times and people we are training people who are over all smarter than our generations recruits we want smarter recruits not meaner and anyone who signs up to be a marine in the first place has a dedication to be the best his country has to offer we do n't have to reinforce that in bootcamp marines come to bootcamp wanting to be killers we do n't need to teach them that by demoralizing them by swearing at them and beating them at least that is how i feel.and yes i am `` qualified '' to say that i have been on the battlefield numerous times and i have trained marines and recruits who eventually ended up on the battlefield but then again what do i know i was just there done that got the t-shirt sgt of the army ....... get a clue,1
when i first saw this movie in the theater i was so angry it completely blew in my opinion i did n't see it for a decade then decided what the hell let 's see i 'm watching all hellraiser movies now to see where it went wrong my guess is it was with sequel 5 that was the first to implement the whole `` i am in a dream omg i see weird stuff oh noes what is happening oh its a dream oh its not a dream oh wait i see something spooky oh never mind '' -sucky storyline those sequels do n't even require the box to be opened or stick to the rules from the first 4 movies that if you saw pinhead you are pretty much screwed and dead the first 3 hellraisers sticked to this storyline which made it so scary in the first place nothing fantasy nothing weird the box got opened boom they came kirstey was the only one that could bargain her way out of it first because of uncle frank then because she had information about the cenobites this movie at least attempts to stick to all that even though it was a bad story it was still somewhat hellraiser no i 'm pretty sure part 5 was the first part to completely and utterly destroy the hellraiser series now they are remaking 1 and i do n't even think i will watch it oh who am i kidding i probably will and probably will be disappointed .... again,0
i myself am a physics student and i have to say i think this is one of the best 'popular introductions to string theory that 's out there the elegant universe manages to make the entire topic of string although it 's actually m theory accessible to a wider audience some 'popular science programmes feel that the best approach is just to throw the audience in at the deep end throwing technical jargon at them without so much as an explanation and presenting the theory in a boring stale style this programme goes through concepts such as general relativity and quantum mechanics and explains the issues that need to be resolved between the two so we have a coherent theory that can be applied to the universe on both a large and small scale i suppose some could say it 's slow and takes too long to get to the interesting stuff like extra dimensions and wormholes but the thing is that 's against the point explaining string theory from the start is nigh on impossible without at least mentioning the physics at its base and the way it 's explained in the elegant universe is clear and entertaining whether you 'll like this program really does depend on if you 're willing to perhaps be initially dumbfounded by some of the ideas that greene presents extra dimensions and warping of spacetime are n't exactly prevalent in everyday life are they but if you persevere with some of the more exotic concepts in this programme you 'll find that it will give you an insight into the research that drives the world of physics today and if you 're studying physics well it 's great entertainment as well as you 'll be likely able to follow this and appreciate it even more,1
although a `` woman 's story '' i found this still fairly interesting it is unusual in that is has three real-life sisters playing sisters in the movie i am referring to priscilla rosemary and lola lane why national critics loved this movie was the presence of bad-boy-rebel john garfield in their twisted liberal-dominated minds all-american characters are sickening but sour-on- life poor-attitude types like garfield played here are people they can identify with despite that this movie still has an overall feeling of goodness which is why i liked it some of the characters may have done stupid things but they good hearts whose heart was bigger than `` ann 's '' priscilla lane in here i agree with the imdb user comments critic in here who says this is priscilla 's film as much as the beloved not by me garfield 's with a director the caliber of michael curtiz the film is better than it might have been under someone else curtiz made sure no scene soapy or otherwise went on too long in addition to the lane sisters and garfield we have claude rains who adds much-needed humor to the story jeffrey lynn the main love interest of the girls gale page dick foran frank mchugh and mae robson apparently this movie must have been a hit because there were several spin-offs from it neither of them approaching this one in content and box-office success,1
sometimes when a film is panned by the critics one just has to see it to see if it is really as bad as the claim well in this case it was i believe it was meant to be a sex comedy but it was neither sexy nor funny i think i chuckled once when johnny vegas failed to vault a roadside fence and that was it the film follows the lives of four men who deliver potatoes for a living each of them has a problem with their sex lives dave has left his wife and seeks out an old flame who once invited him for a threesome a few years before ferris is living with his mother in law who treats him as a sex object tolly has an obsession for involving strawberry jam in his encounters and jeremy claims to be in a loving relationship but is in fact stalking some poor woman the tone of the jokes varies from tasteless to `` i do n't believe that anybody could write that '' an example of the the latter being when they tell a small child his father has died in a car crash then for the punch line when the boy asks how his mum is they tell him she is in a coma the blame for this all lands squarely at the feet of the writers the actors obviously made a poor choice agreeing to be in this film but i did n't think their acting was all that bad ... not that it was all that good either surprisingly for a fairly sleazy film about sex there is no nudity and the sex is never erotic i certainly would n't recommend seeing this for any reason other than morbid curiosity although judging from other reviews this seems to be a love it or loathe it film i suspect it would be better watched after a few beers and with your mates,0
did i waste my time this is very pretentious film in the beginning you will think there 's something going on but by the time some 30 minutes go by you realize nothing is happening i waited for another 20 minutes and by then i was so frustrated that i started reading reviews on imdb and realized that the director has wasted precious time of so many people unbelievably boring pointless film stay away so many good soundtracks i will give one point for the police inspector joke because that worked for me i laughed for a long time but otherwise a very bad film stay away.1 on 10,0
this agreeably perverse and oddball early 80 's teen body count flick may never reach the astonishingly bent pinnacle of the deeply unsettling and criminally underrated murderous moppets movie `` devil times five '' but it 's still an above average killer kid opus nonetheless the slim but serviceable plot centers on a trio of misfit tykes -- two bratty boys and one creepily twinkle-eyed albeit angelic-looking little girl -- who are all born during a solar eclipse on june 9th 1970. when the strange antisocial trio who stick together in a tightly self-contained and exclusive circle reach ten years of age they suddenly go homicidally bonkers and declare open season on the hapless unsuspecting local yokels of the heretofore sleepy and peaceful california suburb of meadowvale writer/director ed hunt the usually incompetent unsung hack responsible for such wonderfully wretched clunkers as the delightfully dopey `` starship invasions '' the uproariously inane jesus christ vigilante parable `` alien warrior '' and the stunningly silly `` the brain '' does a pretty solid and capable job here the kill scenes are abundant and reasonably brutal the arrow-through-the-eye gag is especially nasty there 's a sizable smattering of gratuitous nudity and soft-core sex a goodly amount of tension is neatly created and maintained some nice dollops of dark humor punctuate the arrestingly warped mayhem and the surprise grim ending manages to be truly jolting moreover the top-drawer cast further elevates the proceedings to the perfectly watchable and absorbing jose ferror as a small-town doctor future `` jake and the fatman '' tv series star joe penny as an amateur astrologer `` the prey '' 's lori lethin as the plucky babysitter heroine susan strasberg as a bitchy school teacher `` american ninja '' 's michael dudikoff as a chowderhead jock and cyril o'reilly the lonely misanthrope vampire in the hauntingly melancholy `` dance of the damned '' as a libidinous teen dude who gets bagged while doing just what you think with some naked hot chick in back of a parked van billy jacoby who went on to star in such late 80 's direct-to-video dross as `` dr. alien '' and `` demonwarp '' andy freeman and especially the eerily adorable elizabeth hoy are genuinely creepy and convincing as the terrible troika of chillingly evil and amoral rugrats and yes that 's none other than julie brown the brassy comedienne who scored a surprise top 40 hit with the hilarious novelty tune `` the homecoming queen 's got ta gun '' as the lovely vacuous full-breasted redhead bimbo who does a great lengthy totally extraneous yet still sizzling and much-appreciated nude striptease while dancing in her bedroom to a cheesy blaring rock song all in all this baby sizes up as a sturdy and satisfying slasher item,1
maybe it 's because i 'm no fan of the comics but if the comics are of the same `` quality '' as the movie it 's hard to believe there are any but this has to be one of the worst movies ever made non-existent plot laughable acting dumb dialogue ... this movie is so bad that it hurts a lot that some people actually gave this one 10/10 is an insult to any good or at least mediocre or at least bad movie if you hate yourself then watch tank girl on another thought if you hate yourself that much maybe you should just commit suicide ... my rating -34/10,0
the first time i saw this movie was on a flight between guangzhou china and los angeles it was a real hoot and made the trip pass with much less discomfort than the normal 10 hour flight i tried to locate a copy of it without success until i discovered a copy for sale on ebay having now watched it twice i recommend it as good entertainment my only real criticisms are that the choice of english translation words for the subtitles is sub par even by normal standards also the subtitling is little to small blends into the movie too often and frequently travels too fast to read well,1
the topic of religion in buñuel films is a point that one as an eater of films as an eater of art or as a person need to analyze hardly one can see to a satirical buñuel in `` la voie lactée '' `` un chien andalou '' or in `` l'age d'or '' is very hard and effective in its critic but when you have seen this and then you see a movie like `` nazarin '' after you see this work you begin to be questioned about its author and much have questioned about what seems to be a contradiction for buñuel thinks but is better not called in this way i think that there 's not any contradiction in its work only that buñuel religion point of view is very diverse as unique in films this beautiful film is based on the novel of benito perez galdós which told us the story of father nazario who lived a humble simple life dedicated to god and to help everyone he lived in a simple and poor region there lived too beatriz who is an abused and abandoned wife she do n't find any sense of her life without her violent macho man she have a kind of repulse to him in the other side is andara one of the towns prostitutes father nazario has been stolen again he blames to andara 's cousin andara hear this and try to fight without success with the priest who do n't believe in violence that night andara find that her cousin is actually a thief she have stole her bellboys andara fights with her cousin with terrible consequences with this andara search mercy from the priest nazario decides to help her knowing well that this could be against his church obviously this thing going to have some consequences since here nazario going to be a pilgrim without nothing even without shoes but with spirit and faith but andara and beatriz want to be with he and be like he to serve god if is the sweetest buñuel film that i have seen so far is too the most spiritual is clear here that the thing that most confuse people with the contradiction is that here we do n't see a buñuel against the power of church we see a buñuel whose film is about church but not in the typical and great satirical way whethever like it is i do n't think that the right word is contradiction actually i find it pleasant and well done and in spite of contain such religious issues as his `` voie lactée '' i found it more a spiritual film but that do n't try to touch in diversity the catholic religion as maybe he touch and laugh of it in another films `` nazarin '' is of father nazario and its perspective front god and the same religion but all of this is at the end analyzed in the spiritual life of this man the other two women are not a contrast but as very well another two perspectives of faith first we have beatriz the mistreated woman that lose all the faith in life first with her husband and then with a little girl who was in her family this little girl was very sick at side of her was too andara the prostitute who run of the justice in the family of the child just religious women there a big pain but faith becomes in father nazario when he arrives with nothing to this town he bless the child a say later she is fine the priest want go on walking but beatriz and andara have recovered the faith in life and want to dedicate their lives to god with father nazario after some complains father nazario decide to be with them discovering with some things until the end how he feels about faith god religion and the person in necessity the people who must request to charity to survive this last issue then must be noted as one possible explanation for the pineapple ending this ending we listen the drums similar to that in `` l'age d'or and a father nazario walking over asking about this things when he refuse the fruit at the first time and at the end decide to receive it as a symbol of necessity or maybe as an answer for its spiritual road that begin being priest meanwhile the two women must take away of the father andara for its crime beautiful scene where she thanks a man who helps father nazario in jail and then she damn the man who hit the priest in jail and beatriz because she prefer be with her macho man in spite that he treat her bad just because she do n't accept that she fall in loved with the priest father nazario and here is maybe the unique place in film to critic church- walk to contradict the church the religion that he serves father nazario is that then is a soft for much but not for me critic for some thing in religion father nazario helping a women who is guilty of a crime of a sin but most of all is one of buñuel analysis of faith and life and he really got it with a beautiful tender sweet and unforgettable film that is without a doubt one of his best sorry for the mistakes ... well if there any,1

mario racocevic from europe is the only user who has posted a comment so far and covers the major points to the film.yet again another difficult film to purchase in the uk.i had to go through `` midnight video '' who have a swedish branch.i went to the post office and bought by mail order this and a similar title at only skr30 a title this film goes under many `` a.k.a 's '' depending on when and where it is marketed.i had previously purchased `` the bloodsucker leads the dance '' which you will find if you search on imdb under `` people '' and input `` krista nell '' .the actor who plays the count on his private island in the latter film had his words dubbed from italian into english by an actor with an unmistakably mournful and rather tired sounding voice.i smiled when i heard this same voice dubbing on the english soundtrack as the police inspector who is investigating the murder of the prostitute killed in the copse in the subject film.my choice of course was to see another outing by the delicious krista nell there are quite a few rather inconsequential sub plots in the movie involving blackmail/extortion sleazy affairs with girlfriends mothers a motor cycle chase resulting in a gangland hit a gangrape by a `` client 's '' motorcycle friends sleazy photography cross dressing by transvestites etc which give a flavour to this film summarised in a word sleaze but artistic sleaze .the aforementioned contributor liked this film but the lowly rating suggests other imdb fans did not albeit without explaining their `` wheres and whyfores '' .personally i thought there were too many subplots and not enough put into the main story and the relationship of these subordinate characters to the central plot and the development of their screen characters.also a professional film editor was sorely needed as some of the scenes appeared to last far too long having made their point so that the film appeared to drag in places e.g the scene of the dancing transvestite.krista nell appears in one fruity scene with a client but this too is but a vignette and i was left wanting more from her the director and the screenplay i love the political incorrectness shown in older films this is 30 years from its making e.g smoking in offices and the way some characters react to each other in the office i would suggest 4/10 as a more realistic rating and i have awarded it as such,0
i was so excited to finally watch `` pulse '' after receiving it from amazon and i have to say i was utterly disappointed i perhaps think i was too hyped up i had expectations set by its fans that simply could n't be met after loving other asian horrors i thought i knew this would find a place in my heart the story was slow painfully so i am a diverse fan of horror i love the brutal bloody craziness of `` the devil 's rejects '' and i love equally the steady growing macabre of `` a tale of two sisters '' `` pulse '' offered little from either spectrum sadly along with the sluggishness of the plot it was also very muddled i had n't a clue why characters were doing what they were doing and how what they were doing would help their problem it seemed as if the director spouted off the plot in a sentence or two and the rest was improf from our actors unlike `` a tale of two sisters '' which also has a rather hard-to-follow plot line `` pulse '' clears up very little at the end and left me feeling frustrated confused and uninterested in the characters endeavors my closing statement about the plot was its inconsistency at first it seemed as if the story was about the ghost world overflowing and their medium of escaping is the internet that 's a damn original idea i like that but as the plot drones on plot-holes and unexplained happenings rearing their heads in it seems the director switched to some apocalyptic tale as evident by the ending that just has n't been clear enough throughout to execute i realize the dreariness of the shots and the setting was intentional to make the viewer feel bleak and isolated but the dullness of the movie was only intensified by the grainy shadowy surroundings i will admit there was a certain feel of surrealism with the movie but that may have just been my attention waning in and out the actions of some of the characters are a little bit ridiculous as well and perhaps if i was more enthralled by the story i would 've been able to suspend more disbelief but as well myself being unmotivated so too were some of the characters like i mentioned previously the logic behind what certain characters did were absent and contributed to the incoherence of the plot perhaps it was a result of the plot 's incoherence that the characters do questionable things to be honest i do n't really care the acting was decent certainly nothing outstanding but nothing terrible either no outliers to mention on either side of brilliant or plain awful now i 'll stop sounding so sour and mention that there were a handful of creepy moments one towards the end especially that if there were more like it throughout i would 've enjoyed this movie almost wholly i thought whenever the website was shown it was pretty unsettling as well as some of the ghostly encounters our two main characters face the things that went on between these ghastly run-ins were just too lackluster baffling and `` wtf '' for me to truly appreciate now for something pertaining to the dvd itself ... magnolia 's release of `` pulse '' comes with subtitles yes but the subtitles are off they are n't said at the correct time of the character 's speech it may sound nit-picking but it bothered me a little and it may bother some others i think this is the only north american release of the film though so you either have to deal or watch dubbing never watch dubbing i tried to like the film i really did i wanted this film to live up to the hype ... but sadly it fell flat for me if you 're looking for other creepy asian cinema i can recommend you `` audition '' `` shutter '' `` a tale of two sisters '' `` strange circus '' and `` marebito '' -- all of which are more my palette,0
i just watched the dresser this evening having only seen it once before about a dozen years ago it 's not a `` big '' movie and does n't try to make a big splash but my god the brilliance of the two leads leaves me just about speechless albert finney and tom courtenay are nothing less than amazing in this movie the dresser is the story of sir an aging shakespearean actor finney and his dresser norman courtenay sort of a valet putting on a production of king lear during the blitz of london in world war ii these are two men each dependent upon the other sir is almost helpless without the aid of norman to cajole wheedle and bully him into getting onstage for his 227th performance of lear and norman lives his life vicariously through sir without sir to need him he is nothing or thinks he is anyway this is a character-driven film the plot is secondary to the interaction of the characters and as such it requires actors of the highest caliber to bring it to life finney only 47 years old is completely believable as a very old very sick petulant bullying but brilliant stage actor he hisses and fumes at his fellow actors even when they 're taking their bows and courtenay is no less convincing as the mincing dresser who must sometimes act more as a mother than as a valet to his elderly employer employer is really the wrong term to use though for although technically their relationship is that of employer and employee most of the time sir and norman act like nothing so much as an old married couple yes there are others in the cast of this movie but there is no question that the true stars are finney courtenay and the marvelous script by ronald harwood that is not to say that there are n't other fine performances most notably eileen atkins as the long-suffering stage manager madge there is a wonderful scene where sir and madge talk about old desires old regrets and what might have been although it does n't get talked about these days it is worth remembering that the dresser was nominated for five academy awards best actor nominations for both finney and courtenay best picture best director peter yates and best adapted screenplay i had remembered this as being a good movie but i was n't prepared to be as completely mesmerized as i was from beginning to end if you want to see an example of what great acting is all about and be hugely entertained all the while then i encourage you to see the dresser,1
this is a pale imitation of 'officer and a gentleman there is no chemistry between kutcher and the unknown woman who plays his love interest the dialog is wooden the situations hackneyed it 's too long and the climax is anti-climactic i love the uscg its men and women are fearless and tough the action scenes are awesome but this movie does n't do much for recruiting i fear the script is formulaic but confusing kutcher 's character is trying to redeem himself for an accident that was n't his fault costner 's is raging against the dying of the light but why his 'conflict with his wife is about as deep as a mud puddle i saw this sneak preview for free and certainly felt i got my money 's worth,0
i had the pleasure to view this film when i was 10 years old having an existing interest in egyptology i know that there are subtle mistakes to the art direction and costuming but over all this is the best film to date with the look of the 18th dynasty the film only approximates mika walteri 's `` the egyptian '' in plot a good portion of the text never made it to film as we have to consider the running length the music score by b. hermann and alfred newman is beautiful performances as follows the late edmond purdom gave an excellent performance as an orphaned child adopted by parents past their child bearing years he states that he keeps to himself has the best education available and lets face it is a rather emotionally distant person given his upbringing and high intellect jean simmons is fine as a humble tavern maid honest loving and sincere bella darvi people complained about her accent well she is a babylonian it is not that apparent in the film as to why sinhue is so insanely obsessed with nefer nefer nefer her correct name in the book sinhue is enjoying her carnal fruits and gets his revenge early in the plot by leaving nefer nefer nefer 's drugged body with the `` house of the dead 's `` workers gene tierney as baketaten is brilliant when she tells sinhue that he is pharoah she looks like she could devour him in his weakness she is intense brilliant and coldly beautiful michael wilding is heartbreakingly tragic in his mission to bring all people to know his one god i believe that we are viewing ankhnaten thru the lens of egyptologist a. weigall a view at the time that had a pre-messiah feeling about ankhnaten 's vocation did his monotheism influence the jewish people note psalm 104. and other egyption imagery in the psalms mr. peter ustinov provided the alter ego to sinhue he is street wise and cunning a survivor excellent acting as always mature never thought much of his acting personally his horemheb is fine as an ambitious `` super patriot '' who ultimately has sinhue murder more than one person in his quest for power walteri 's book i felt that the ending to the egyptian was confusing as sinhue 's personality changes too easily he has a living son toth dies in the novel power is handed to him through is half sister baketaten he world savvy now and has a grip on international affairs so he became enlightened he could have modified the amon priesthood as he was capable but no sinhue gives everything up everything including his son 's future to become a ragged beggar preaching monotheistic love this change was too immediate and the major flaw in the script again the look of the film colour most of the costumes nefer nefer nefer 's gold dress was too over the top as she is more richly dressed than the royal family music is beautiful i will watch this film again easily p.s i know that you porbably know that horemheb did not directly succceed ankhnaten but i could not resist stating this fact,1
the movie has taken a little flack for playing fast and loose with the facts but it will put you close to being in a time and place that no longer exist by getting to the feeling as keith richards remarks in paul mccartney 's movie about holly there 's some buddy holly in almost all rock made since his day the tragedy that took him is dealt with gently and the rest of the movie recreates the joy of a great music career and a joyful body of music gary busey does a remarkable energetic portrayal of holly and his performances hint that he really gets into the music as a long-time holly fan and rocker so do i,1
i 've been waiting since last october to see this film it was supposed to come out october '98 and now i 've finally seen it i am not disappointed bloody marvellous ok it was a tad slow in the beginning but once it got going it 's a very exciting nail-biting tense robert carlyle is so different from either gaz in 'the full monty and begbie in 'trainspotting that it 's hard to recognise him and johnny lee miller no longer with his sick boy from 'trainspotting blond hair plays his dashing gentlemen highway man with the right about of humour and sensitivity that it is easy to see why liv tylers rebecca falls for him a great film as hades in disney 's 'hercules would say `` two thumbs way way up '',1
so lame it is n't even funny a zombie infection overtakes a small college campus and a government squad of secret operatives back up a couple of scientists sent to find the origin of the outbreak collecting zombie dna damn sure is not easy once bitten you 're one of `` them '' the entire university has been completely infected by the run amok undead this sequel does not even redeem the awful original house of the dead 2003 senseless entertainment is accomplished though a few glimpses of female nakedness added to a gaggle of gore and exploding heads should keep any zombie freak happy credited cast members emmanuelle vaugier victoria pratt ed quinn sid haig and nadine velazquez the `` f '' word holds together an unimaginative script,0
so i decided to watch the entire puppet master series and had just watched parts 1-3 which i thought were all excellent they had a unique charm to them and a certain intelligence that i really appreciated about a year ago i even saw puppet master vs. demonic toys which of course was bad but still a terrific guilty pleasure and fun to watch from the very beginning of this film i knew it was in trouble the cheesy power rangers-style egyptian skull villain who watches the puppets 'rita repulsa-style through his pyramid glass came straight out of left field all of the additions to this franchise in this story were completely absurd suddenly we have a grand assortment of all kinds of new and random characters and plots that are a far cry from the first three films i seriously doubt that when the first puppet master was being penned the writers had visions of someday seeing an egyptian power rangers villain totem monsters annoying twenty-somethings who seriously ca n't act and are supposed to be brilliant scientists but never say anything intelligent and a lame `` decapitron '' puppet who 's head can morph into the ghost of toulon another thing that greatly disappointed me in this film was that it completely ignores what happened in the last entry part ii since iii was a prequel suddenly the puppets are back at bodega bay inn back in their case minus blade and toulon for some reason is willing to help his puppets again he betrays them in part ii for his love of elsa this is n't explained at all ... and so with that and all of this other junk thrown in i was no longer amused i 'm a huge fan of ridiculous b movies a connoisseur if you will i even collect laser discs of rare b movies you ca n't find on dvd and so it takes a lot for me to say that this was one of the most absurd movies i have ever seen in my life i still love those puppets the original ones blade tunneler pinhead jester and the rest and if they had only stuck with what they had rather than trying to fix something that was n't broken well the series might still be alive and in good health that being said even though the reviews are n't so great i 'm really interested in checking out puppet master retro sounds like an interesting one that pays great tribute to the original themes,0
as i sat in the theater almost crying to myself in dismay over the atrocity ron howard and tom hanks call the da vinci code i could not see the light at the end of the tunnel that is angels and demons hanks and company are back for the sequel-prequel angels and demons and they have learned their lesson acting wise everyone is much better aylet zurer is very good as vittoria vetra and better than the girl who played sophie neveau tom hanks is very good as always he is better in this though because he works harder at giving the movie the feeling that it is a thriller i think ewan mcgregor does the best job of any of the actors he might even deserve a nomination come march but doubtful he had me convinced right until the very end he 's dynamic and faithful but rational and realizes that the church needs to put their past behind them the minor actors also do very good jobs technically and visually the movie is much improved the cinematography is much ... much better and the visual effects are superb the final explosion sequence at the end is excellent howard does a masterful job taking you through a tour of rome pacing wise ron howard does an amazing job this time around at keeping the story moving and not boring us with a history lesson deemed at denouncing christianity the movie also makes you feel like more is at stake in our feeble minds discovering whether or not jesus had children is not as high up on the list compared to a cataclysmic explosion killing thousands including the roman catholic church part of the reason i think the story is so fast paced is due to the excellent score i can not say enough about the score it was epic at times like something from lord of the rings but then sometimes it felt like a bourne movie which is a nice mix my only complaint about this movie is that it is ridiculously far fetched the chances of the carmelengo being someone of ewan mcgregors age are highly improbable and the chances of a cardinal with an adopted son getting elected pope are even more ridiculous not to mention the whole antimatter thing which has yet to be created and dan brown wrote the book in 2003 ... overall angels and demons is much tighter knitt faster paced more exciting and more important movie than the da vinci code this is must see thriller for anyone who loves history and mystery combined into one,1
i think homegrown is a bit of a misnomer for this movie more like `` plantation grown '' but it does n't have quite the same ring to it my guide described it a comedy but the pathetic travails of these hapless buffoons is not my idea of a belly laugh more in the genre of the farcical thriller/drama the characters developed well enough an all-star cast made it oh-so promising just a shame the plot was patently absurd ted danson provided a fine cameo as did jamie lee curtis in her walk-on part jon bon jovi has this amazing ability to measure thc content in the front seat of his car i guess if you imbibe a few beforehand you should be able to sit through this one not for the gun shy paranoid types though,0
this one was truly awful watching with fascinated horror i kept on asking `` why have they done this '' that is taken all the scenarios out of `` the day after tomorrow '' `` the perfect storm '' and `` twister '' and remixing them in a three-hour miniseries directed by long-time junk tv director dick lowry with every disaster movie cliché known to man and not an ounce of real suspense many of the cast were unknown canadians and location filming was done in canada winnepeg doubling for chicago so no doubt tax breaks had something to do with it although some ambitious special effects were attempted the execution is so poor no decent spectacle is achieved the actors may be a competent lot the script is so bad no-one had a chance to show it except perhaps for randy quaid as tommy the tornado chaser who went right over the top and was quite amusing believe it or not the producers have since made another one of these canadian disaster turkeys called `` category 7  the end of the world '' which was very tastefully shown on cbs in the us a few weeks after hurricane katrina how could the network of ed murrow and walter cronkite do such a thing in prime time pt barnum `` nobody ever went broke underestimating public taste '' is proved right once more,0
one comment said it was n't a comedy ... mistake it was a delightful comedy of a period of history that does n't lend itself easily to that genre very busy ... and active film from beginning to end often the shots out the window of the train or car were just beautiful an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours in a theater all the french historical figures like charles de gaulle and petain and the some of the people involved in the french resistance were included in the script which might send those who are unfamiliar with the collapse of france under the german invasion might want to research the characters were engaging and the actors portraying them were excellent recommend it 9 out of 10,1
i do n't pretend to be a huge asterix fan having only seen one other movie adaption and read only two of the comics but this was a superb movie all the same i only saw the english version and found the voices to go perfectly with the characters brad garret as obelix and sean astin as justforkix especially the story itself was both interesting and truly funny especially the contradicting name endings all the viking names end in `` af '' while all the gaulish names of course end in `` ix '' with a little romance thrown in that i though enhanced the story even though it weighed down the overall production with unnecessary clichés the plot is this the viking chief timandahaf is sick and tired of going to raid villages and then finding them emptied so he consults his `` wise man '' cryptograf whose entire repertoire consists of old proverbs and cryptograf tells him that `` fear lends the villagers wings '' taking this literally timandahaf believes that fear actually allows people to fly and sets out on an expedition to retrieve the `` champion of fear '' an expedition that of course leads him to the gaulish village where asterix and obelix live the pair are currently very frustrated chief vitalstatistix 's cowardly pacifist nephew justforkix has been entrusted to them so they can train him to be a man and the boy is making little to no progress when justforkix unwittingly confesses to being `` afraid of everything '' in the presence of the brainless viking olaf he is believed to be the `` champion of fear '' and is kidnapped asterix and obelix are sent by vitalstatistix to go rescue justforkix before his father returns to the village to bring his son back home ultimately this is a great movie with few flaws besides the clichés and at times defective dialogs i thoroughly enjoyed it despite the fact that it was n't true to the comic,1
when a dowdy wife shearer loses her husband she decides to completely make herself over to win him back not `` politically correct '' by today 's standards but still fun to watch especially the scenes with marie dressler and hedda hopper,1
i remember running home from school almost every day to catch ktla 's channel 5 monster movies but never did i run home faster then when this movie was scheduled somehow the idea of being a boy and having a giant robot as a friend appealed to me in a very unique way sure i pretended to be spiderman batman and other superheros but i really wanted to be johnny sakko over any of them i have not seen this movie in 30 years and i can still remember it vividly who can forget the way giant robot shot missiles out of his fingers or how about the way ghuillotene threw his fingernails to make explosions geez i can even still whistle the theme music that plays at the end which is so tragic that i remember crying myself to sleep a number of times only one other movie has the kind of magic that this movie does in my mind and that is the wizard of oz but i have seen that movie many times since i was a kid of course the wizard of oz is a true classic whereas voyage into space is low budget nonsense these two films should n't even be mentioned in the same sentence but to a young boy it is n't high production values or continuity that capture your heart its flying monkeys and giant robots p.s my cousin use to do a very accurate impression of giant robot he pronounced it `` giant robutt '' if you recall giant robot had a particular way of shooting his missiles and my cousin had it down cold i made him repeat the routine endlessly for my personal amusement,1
it 's hard to believe a movie can be this bad but you live and learn what 's more amazing is the fact that the people who put this thing together likely had college educations meanwhile the fruit of their labor bares the appearance of something a group of five eighth graders may have come up with on the bright side if there is one the soundtrack has some nice moments which is another reason to question how the rest of the film can be so hideously bad,0
a classic late 50 's film the superannuated headliners joan crawford and louis jordan are not at their best but the direction cinematography and acting of the younger cast are compelling in a 50 's sense which i love the look and feel of the artsy over-artsy contemporary film `` far from heaven '' reflects exactly this sort of film and i suspect this film may be one of the models a silly plot of course hey it 's 1959 but as a film -- glorious as a reflection of the society extremely interesting and as witness to how hollywood breaks away from the idealistic portrayal of american sexual mores fascinating,1
despite the previous reviewer 's screed this is a well paced and interesting documentary with lots of clips from classic 1950s sci-fi films that influenced spielberg lucas and others in their more recent efforts i agree that spielberg 's films are n't even in the same league as the films discussed here such as william cameron menzies brilliant invaders from mars to name just one of the many titles examined but this is still a remarkably good overview of 1950s paranoid sci-fi yes it turns into a commercial for the tepid remake of war of the worlds during the last fifteen minutes you can turn that off the rest is surprisingly good and it 's nice to see contemporary filmmakers remember the films that inspired them even if they ca n't begin to match the originals,1
honestly i did n't really have high expectations for this movie but at the same time i was hopeful having it be directing by albert pyun one of the more well known b-movie auteur 's did n't exactly raise my hopes i mean how many albert pyun flicks rank that highly yeah exactly ... but still the movie advertised a decent cast rob lowe burt reynolds pre-reborn stardom ice-t and mario van peebles it all amounts to squat however as the movie is so boring and moves so slowly that the energy just seemed to drain right out of me the longer it went on it runs over 90 minutes but it 's telling a story that could have been told in 30 minutes flat i do n't know what pyun was going for here i mean the movie drips artsy-like style but it 's a blur at times and maybe i 'm an idiot for expecting more from pyun this time around here he seemed to actually have a budget and a potentially great cast for the material but it 's all wasted crazy six is n't much of an action film it 's not much of anything really i guess what 's the saddest here is the fact that i found the end credits the most entertaining part of the movie the music score is actually half-decent with some smooth female vocals too but the rest is a complete waste and the less said the better avoid,0
i just finished this movie and my only comment is `` oh wow '' jennifer beals is ok as the fiancee but yancy butler as the female dance instructor is pure sexual dynamite having watched her in witchblade i was not prepared for the pure unadulterated sensuality and raw sexual excitement she launches onto the screen i got ta see this movie again .... if only for yancy butler as corrinne,1
i rented a copy of this one from netflix -- big mistake the dvd version titled `` the one-armed swordsmen '' was produced by madmen who thought that the fighting sequences would be appreciated better pasted all together in one big chapter than as part of a consistent sequential story some of the story was left in separate chapters which you can select from the main menu but the dvd is still a mess do n't rent or buy it not that there was anything wonderful about the original story an absurdly complicated piece of nonsense much as i liked seeing wang yu in his prime again after all these years this one is an utter waste of time i 've had dish detergents that made a better film than this what the chopped-up dvd version shows us is that no matter how silly a chinese script may be you have to see some sort of story to care about how the fighting sequences turn out but `` the one-armed swordsmen '' does offer you do the chance to see both wang and shaw brothers stalwart lo lieh beating up smirking pretty boy david chiang -- it 's always a pleasure to see that happen lo plays a sort of second-string villain here and serves as a prime example of why some people really need orthodontists he film is also graced by the participation of taiwanese actor chang yi as the magistrate another comment above mentions the obligatory fight-in-the-inn scene there are two in fact where wang and chiang are attacked by a pack of comical barbarians using what look like cavemen weapons making bruce lee noises while they fight none of this makes any sense but that 's okay if you 're not expecting any clarity or common sense it was fun to watch anyway another peculiarity of this production is that there are no significant women characters there are a couple of female roles but they play no serious role in the action or the plot if you can find a copy of the original shaw brothers one-armed swordsman movie the one which explains why he has only the one arm and why he uses a broken sword go for it,0
my first post at the imdb has to unfortunately be to warn others not to waste their time with the cavern there is no story no character development no scares and no good lighting it does n't make any sense if you enjoy bad acting people running through small portions of caves bouncing cameras posed at bad angles and people screaming while the screen is in complete darkness you 'll love this movie i could shut the lights off in my house and scream too and i would n't have to pay for the rental the only thing that scared me was that someone actually made a movie this awful ... one of the worst movies i 've ever rented,0
i would not recommend it whatsoever it was like getting stuck in the middle row of a theater so i could n't leave and watching a part porn movie except they did n't take their clothes off it was the body language and definitely the language i have to say i was embarrassed filming was very low budget no good dialogue yuck actors stunk except the two best characters who got killed off and they were david carradine and dennis hopper it did smack of kill bill and that old movie with the two guys who ride the dessert on their chopppers you know what i mean blablabla the filming was grainy and just a very low quality there was nobody in that theater that liked this movie and the people around me were younger and tattooed,0
i saw i smell the dead -- sorry i sell the dead -- at a press screening glenn mcquaid the film 's writer-director-editor is a laddish irishman who introduced the screening by announcing that -- whilst it was in progress -- he would be 'going out for a pint i do n't begrudge him a drink but -- by telling us about it -- he seemed to feel he needed to certify his laddishness or his irishness or both when the opening credits rolled there were -- as usual at press screenings -- loud ovations for the names of every actor or crew member who 'd got friends in the audience and silence for those who had n't mcquaid returned for a witty q a afterwards this horror movie does n't take itself seriously which is good because its humour is considerably stronger than its horror only one scene is even remotely scary and most of the 'horror is merely gross-out but i laughed throughout much of the film this movie appears to be set in ireland circa 1850 by which time grave-robbing was mostly defunct the story is told in flashback we get flashbacks within flashbacks and the narrating character flashbacks material that he could n't know about because sometimes he was n't present or in one case because the action is unfolding behind his back the story begins with a prisoner being taken to the guillotine guillotines were n't used in 19th-century ireland but -- for once -- we actually see a plausible guillotine sequence the prisoner struggles on his way to execution the rope cleats are accurate and the prisoner manages to look up to see the blade overhead and there 's a payoff later to justify the historically inaccurate use of the guillotine itself the characters are ostensibly irish but one major character speaks in cockney slang using phrases like `` a mug 's game '' and `` take a butcher 's '' for 'have a look for once actors in 19th-century roles display 19th-century dental hygiene yet nearly all the clothes and hairstyles and the women 's make-ups are resolutely 21st-century i 'm not complaining in the case of heather bullock who wears a very fetching black miniskirt cozzie that appears to be pvc phworr the lead actors except ron perlman are excellent but most of the supporting cast have no sense of the victorian period the worst offender is joel garland as the publican whose characterisation is firmly rooted in the twenty-first century just when i thought that garland 's performance could n't get any less victorian he used his fingers to make `` ironic '' air-quotes the sets especially angus scrimm 's lab are detailed and impressive yet failed to convince me that people actually lived and worked in these places nearly every interior contains burning candles but never once did i see what would have been there if these were actual victorian homes or workplaces leftover drippings from previous candles one scene features an extra-terrestrial i was annoyed that mcquaid plumped for a stereotypical `` grey '' schwa alien rather than something original there are splendid montage sequences but mcquaid opts for flashy effects -- split-screens overhead shots -- that do n't serve the story i was impressed by a recurring blue-screen device superimposing the main characters heads over other backgrounds less effective was a recurring 'creepshow'-style motif of camera shots morphing actors faces into drawings resembling panel art from 1950s ec horror comics i 'm a fan of ec comics but they do n't belong in 19th-century ireland the money that mcquaid spent on flashy photo f/x -- showing off his editing skills without serving the story -- should 've been spent on accurate costumes big spoilers now ron perlman gives an `` oirish '' performance full of acting-school tics ostensibly playing a 19th-century irish priest he writes with his left hand in victorian ireland left-handed children were punished for using `` the devil 's hand '' and were forcibly retrained to become righties but perlman 's character turns out to have a reason for concealing his right hand elsewhere a character is bitten by a zombie yet suffers no ill effects so i knew there 'd be a payoff later several scenes that would more logically take place at night are shot in daylight apparently only because this was easier and less expensive since mcquaid is a proficient director and editor he could easily have shot `` day for night '' ... but using a process-photography effect to help tell the story seems to interest him much less than showing off his flashy editing techniques mcquaid seems to be giving homage to those great old hammer horror flicks but those hammers were so great because the actors and production designers worked hard to convince us that we were actually witnessing events in 1888 whitechapel or wherever i sell the dead almost entirely fails to evoke the 19th century glenn mcquaid shows talent as a director scripter and editor yet in all three capacities here he makes odd choices ... then largely fails to justify those choices but i enjoyed i sell the dead i 'll rate it 7 out of 10 and i look forward to his next movie,1
you could tell from the opening shot of the conveyor belt in the bank that this was going to be a great film a touch minimalist in feel with a twist of retro this film oozes style -the brilliant camera-work acting script and the manner that the secret life of the protagonist unfolds all complement each other in possibly making the best italian film i 've ever seen up there with la stanza del figlio albeit different shame on the people sitting behind me who made it obvious that they could n't see the relevance of the slow but painfully beautiful scenes meticulously crafted by the camera do n't miss,1
i tried to watch this adaptation but it was just so awful i could n't torture myself like that the performances were quite sub-par with the exception of ariel fonda was way over the top in a role that should be handled with some subtlety i have studied shakespeare and seen many adaptations and this is by far the worst one i have ever seen i have to wonder why on earth someone made this film shakespeare can and has been beautifully adapted in many cases this is not one of them if you must watch this film may i suggest a drinking game take a drink every time they go off book from the original idea and two drinks every time fonda overacts you should be quite drunk in a very short time,0
i liked this movie i 'm not a big horror movie buff so i could n't comment on similarities between this and other movies of this genre but i found this movie quite captivating the story line albeit a little obvious had some genuinely scary/tense moments and the acting particually of the lead female role was n't bad in anyway overall i 'm a little surprised at the low rating this movie has gotten i watch a lot of movies working in a video store tends to help and this really is n't as bad as people seem to think i do have some criticism though the final call from the cop was terrible almost overacted the dead girl in the bathroom looked liked she was having a little sleep probably from the amount of tequila she mentioned she drank and the children 's reaction to what was happening instilled in me the hope that they were ultimately killed hope this helps some people,1
a poetic examination of the human condition performed without dialogue the anti-hero the man builds a contraption to escape a band of marauders out of the wastland of what was once a civilization to the ruins of the city to scavenge for his survival there he crosses pathes with the brute brilliantly played by jean reno of `` the professional '' and `` mission impossible '' fame the man is rescued by a crazy old genius who lives in a fortress of his own design by using their wits the man and the old genius are able to keep the brute and his ilk at bay but they realise it is only a matter of time before their defenses are compromised so they make a break for it this is a strongly understated tale of the desparate struggle for life with excellent action scenes and clever humor of all of the movies of its kind like `` road warrior '' `` omega man '' and even `` ultimate warrior '' featuring yul brenner as a buff knife-fighter `` le dernier combat '' is the most artfully crafted copies of the video are hard-to-find i would give my left eye ball for one if your local art house ever has a revival of this film i heartily recommend that you break any engagement to able to be able to see it big,1
the box 2009 cameron diaz james marsden frank langella james rebhorn holmes osborne sam oz stone celia weston truly disappointing adaptation of genre legend richard matheson 's sci-fi chiller `` button button '' by on the wane wunderkind filmmaker richard kelly who truly stretches a small well-crafted piece into a grab-bag 'wtf'-a-thon mysterious and ridiculously maimed man langella posits a million dollar offer to 'struggling couple diaz and marsden both surprisingly vanilla bland to the hilt a box with a red-button that when pushed will kill some stranger in the world sure strings are attached but does that really matter here what does is why in the name of god does kelly trowel on so much oddness i.e nose-bleeds watery transport systems  that 's right  watery.transport.systems when the tension should be strung as tautly as possible oh the possibilities if this sounds like a bad twilight zone episode you are half right the '80s tv re-boot actually did a decent small-screen adaptation in fact rent that instead one of the year 's worst films,0
a young woman jodie foster is witnessing a mafia murder reports the killing to the local police and becomes herself a hit target by the mob operatives a professional killer dennis hopper hired by mafia is stalking her to prepare for the hit but eventually he falls for her then as a parody of the stockholm syndrome that defines a case when an abducted hostage begins to like and cooperate with the kidnapper jodie foster falls for her abductor too make love and both prepare for a getaway denis hopper the actor tries to align himself with the creative ambitions of dennis hopper the director the result is disappointing and fails to keep pace with the artistic level of a great performer as dennis hopper is there is no real thrill and the script is sometimes naive and predictable the film is saved to some extent by the performance of jodie foster who is not at her best but still shines with her talent beauty and gift of historical interest is the short appearance of vincent price and in a small act of charlie sawn known from his great part in `` wall street '' if you decide to spend the 116 minutes to see the film it is not a complete loss this movie offers easy entertainment but we would expect much more from the director of `` easy rider '' and the actress who gave us the character of sarah tobias in `` the accused '',0
sam firstenberg 's `` ninja 3 the domination '' mixes martial arts with `` the exorcist '' like horror.the horror elements thrown on screen are simply laughable but the film works as a mindless action/martial arts flick.the fight scenes are well-choreographed and exciting and the film is never boring.so forget stupid dialogue lame acting and annoying soundtrack-grab some beer and check this one out highly recommended,1
do not waste your money or time terrible movie bad acting plot all over the place really really bad acting man this movie is just plain bad i shut it off at 7 minutes the script is bad the directing is bad it seems to me that a high school group got together to do a project for their drama class yes it 's that bad the acting is not convincing at all mind you i saw only 7 minutes of it how this movie made it to dvd is beyond me it should have been left in the editing storage room i saw the cover and thought it was pretty cool i sure 's heck wo n't do that next time,0
wow i was told this would be a b movie worth watching i feel that i was misled after seeing this preview event the plot is a twisted make of several films at best even the title is a take on another film if you can give the movie that much credit i am sorry to say that i was taken to the cleaners i would n't waste your time on this one this movie appears to be a bunch of wannabes who got together and made a poor idea of a movie on a weekend with a borrowed camera being in the entertainment business i can judge a decent film and this one deserves to be shelved or discarded my advice stick to a classic like the 1979 dawn of the dead on a scale of 1 to 10 even a 1 is being nice to producers because this movie blows below limit of what sucks the producers need to stay with their daytime jobs if you do view the movie please be honest in your posting this one seems to have been hyped up and inflated by a few there are a few who have seen this for what it is and posted correctly sorry but i have to say this is one to be skipped,0
i first heard of this film when patton oswalt talked about it on his `` werewolves and lollipops '' cd he said it was a lost classic that is completely ridiculous being a lover of terrible cinema i knew i was in for a treat this film is hands down one of the weirdest i 've ever seen certainly one of the weirdest shlock films basically a demon took human form years ago for a woman the woman died or something the demon cried blood the blood fell on the bed the bed is now possessed and it now eats along with fruit flowers and chicken it also has a taste for people the people can range between horny teens mayors gangsters servants or professional orgy throwers there 's also a sick guy who the bed ate but put his soul behind a picture in the room most movies let you figure out the plot through exciting action death bed takes another path it basically tells you through narration exactly what 's happening while slow dull murder scenes take place also i must say everyone who 's eaten by the bed are surprisingly quiet i would think if a bed is eating you through the ways of a 5th grade science fair experiment it would sting a little i guess nerve endings were n't invented until 1981 or so the story is wacky the direction is slow and pretty awful the sets are sparse the acting it fairly painful and the brother is one of the unintentionally ugliest actors i 've ever seen probably would make a great party film if alcohol and smart-asses are involved certainly one you should n't miss,0
i remember catching this film on a c4 screening a year ago and i was completely blown away by the whole thing i thought the film managed to represent such a diversity of genres the supernatural a love story the intrigue of crime and so many more i was hooked on the whole thing after a minute or so and was really concerned about the characters it made me feel terrified at one second for jimmy and then had me laughing away at the gangsters in the next ... and all the time i had my fingers crossed that things would work out for jimbo heath ledger and rose bryne are superb bryan brown is absolute quality and had me creasing up along with david field who was funny as well as being an evil git since i saw this film i managed to order it on dvd and as a result every person i show it to has been hooked in much the same way this film is perfect for a sunday afternoon or a lazy evening and it 's one that you can really appreciate with your mates around,1
often considered argento 's last `` great '' film this entry into the giallo canon is unquestionably better than any argento film that has followed it though i have yet to see `` mother of tears '' but to call it his last `` great '' film might be stretching it a bit the directorial and stylistic flourishes the hallmark of all argento films is indeed present with some of his sequences of suspense ranking up with his best the `` peephole '' sequence is especially memorable and the cinematography by ronnie taylor is outstanding the fluorescent lighting is beautiful however the narrative which is hit and miss in all of argento 's films is missing here there is indeed a potent sense of mystery and intrigue but the plot resorts to what is essentially a string of murder sequences with one following the another leaving no real time to fully construct a right focused mystery to be solved all of this results in a climax that is ... well ... anti-climatic as the film did not invest enough interest to make us truly care regardless this is recommended simply due to the masterful direction and beautiful imagery that argento evokes i would n't recommend this as a starting point for argento 's films however for that i would recommend either `` deep red '' or `` suspiria '' but if you enjoyed those or even any giallo then this is a very good addition to your viewing repertoire,1
this is a film that i keep coming back to for a variety of reasons as a testament to the suffering of the ordinary soldier on the eastern front in the second world war it is a powerful one there are a number of very powerful scenes in the film which help to capture the horror of war such as the tank battle for instance furthermore from what i can see the experiences documented in the film are by and large 'true if you read a. beevor 's book 'stalingrad you will know what i mean the film is also successful in the sense that it does n't allow character or plot to dominate it it is simply a tale of survival that attempts to depict the battle mainly from the ordinary german soldier 's point of view i 've read somewhere that the original screenplay had to be toned down which does n't surprise me at all if they tried to really show what the battle was like it would have been almost impossible to make i 'm sure even so there are still some moments that are difficult to watch this was made before private ryan but is possibly even harder-hitting in places just one word of caution do n't buy the dubbed 'english version it 's pretty awful and spoils the film try to get a copy in the original german version with english subtitles it 's far more powerful you may need to buy a region 1 dvd of the film in this case as i did,1
all the characters in this cartoon were hilarious norman the viking guardian had some memorable phrases and the skull master the bad guy would always be vowing to kill max with some insane cackling the writing is the best i was glued to the set when this would come on when i was younger if they came out with a dvd of all the episodes they made i would be forced to buy it this and a conan the barbarian cartoon are the ones i miss the most from childhood i think these cartoons are the most unappreciated out of all the great cartoons i used to watch these cartoons on channel 13 in the los angeles area i remember the owl was always afraid warning max that he was in trouble and that he was the chosen one max did n't believe that he was the chosen one and always gave the owl trouble norman was less talkative but his simplicity was funny he would say things like `` i eat monsters for breakfast '' when he was battling them and then when he was battling zombies he would say `` i eat zombies for ... nevermind '' classic cartoon comedy and action i vote that they re-air mighty max,1
ok to start with this movie was not at all like the book i read the book when i was 13 and since then it has always been my favorite when i 'm waiting for a different book to come out this is the book i turn to to fill in the time i have 3 copies for god 's sake anyways i knew this was not going to be anything like the book but come on they could have done a little better than this i mean seriously if i wanted to watch american werewolf in paris or london than i would watch those movies they took a perfectly good story and twisted it around into a copy of a story that has been told over and over again and quite frankly i 'm tired of watching it i mean hello the best part of the whole f g sorry story is she ends up with gabriel he does n't die what was that about and he 's old in this movie gabriel is supposed to be only 24 not 44 da it awww and astrid who the he came up with the idea of astrid being vivian 's aunt no no no no astrid and vivian hate each other awwww anyways yeah that was my little rant seriously pi ed off hope this helped,0
we 've seen a story like this before a wife in marital troubles played by nastassja kinski engages in sex with a stranger william baldwin and then wants to go back to her life with husband and girl when she returns home she finds out that her husband has finally found a job everything seems bright however kinski finds out that her husband 's new boss is actually the stranger who still shows interest over her and seems to do anything to get what he wants what to do say nothing i did n't really like the movie while it was n't just bad it clearly lacked `` that something '' maybe it should 've focused more on what 's going inside kinski 's head nothing to say about the actors themselves i guess baldwin was a good choice for the role of the obsessed boss but the characters seemed somewhat stereotypical acting the way you would see characters acting in your everyday tv films finally the ending totally ruined what could have been an interesting plot in my opinion the movie tried to look cool it had a bit of shaky camerawork here and there some stills fast cuts and glamour but in the end i think it fits spelling productions much better same goes for the music otherwise it did n't look that bad some might like this but it definitely was n't my cup of tea to be fair i do n't usually watch much this type of thrillers this one felt too long even if it was just an hour and a half long i think it could 've worked better as an hour long episode in some tv series there was absolutely no need for some of the scenes especially the shower scene my advice try before you buy,0
the book was one of stephen king 's best the movie was pure rubbish it was painful to remain in the theater until the ending which was n't even the same as the book i guess that this is the result when you try to cram 10 pages of story into every minute there is no good reason to watch this movie,0
it 's really not worthy of a 'best picture consideration but as entertainment goes it does the job this is one that i 've watched with pulse quickening every time at least a dozen times most of these actors were unknown at the time this was done and we can recognize them from other work those that do n't have current name recognition probably do n't want it this was a fun adventure sort of like the little rascals if they just had to be serious,1
it was so boring no plot whatsoever basically a watered-down version of the lion king mixed in with animal farm again no plot at all horrible worst hour and a half of my life oh my gosh i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief i maybe chuckled twice all of the semi-funny parts are in the previews i hate movies like that yeah the movie pretty much sucked i do n't know how it got such good ratings and reviews there is no plot or storyline if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriend/boyfriend to keep you occupied through out awful i do n't think i 've ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if i 'd have paid 7.50 to see this crap,0
i used to watch this show when i was growing up when i think about it i remember it very well if you ask me it was a good show two things i remember very well are the opening sequence and theme song in addition to that everyone was ideally cast the writing was also very strong the performances were top-grade too i hope some network brings it back so i can see every episode before i wrap this up i 'd like to say that i 'll always remember this show in my memory forever even though i have n't seen every episode now in conclusion if some network ever brings it back i hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good,1
flawless writing and brilliant acting make this unusually delightful and witty plot-twister one of the best american films i have seen this year neil labute 's terrific casting and cynical direction keeps this film from becoming too sentimental while renée zellweger and morgan freeman 's authentic performances give it a soul violent provocative and humorous at the same time with a truly wonderful ending chris rock greg kinnear aaron eckhart crispin glover and allison janney all give uproarious tongue in cheek performances the greatest spoof of soap operas since the movie soap but better and smarter 9 out of 10,1
i am astonished at the major comments here for this ok surf film it really stems from the `` california dreamin '' school of barnyard to beach antics and is n't really plausible the idea that the lead kid learn to ride a board so well in a concrete wave pool that he beats the real surfers at their game in the real ocean is just plain silly in australia where most urban teens do surf this film was laughed at audiences took it all with a grain of sea salt made in the 80s but with its heart in the 60s it is fun to watch and looks and sounds good but it is not a in a classic class at all even the actors did n't outlast this we 're seriously in liquid bridge or ride the wild surf or beach blanket bingo land here oz stars like occy and big wednesday hero gerry lopez are drafted in to add head nodding recognition to our farm boy 's wave prowess but it only made the crowd in the cinema guffaw it is for 10 years olds who do not question much it 's not even in gods hands and that was silly too,0
i have not figured out what the chosen title has to do with the movie this is another gathering of monsters just like the house of frankenstein not exactly a masterful plot but universal needed to capitalize again dr. edelman onslow stevens is either very ambitious or over the top in the ego department he is working on the cure to keep larry talbot from turning into the wolf man somehow count dracula happens to drop by to get a fix on his vampirism and rounding out the good doctor 's experiments is the restoring of the frankenstein monster 's energy along the way the kind hearted doctor 's blood is tainted with that of dracula john carradine plays dracula again this time he is more convincing lon chaney jr. as usual is the soulful wolf man glenn strange is the frankenstein monster who has very little to do this outing also with mentionable roles are lionel atwill and martha o'driscoll,0
this movie gives golf a high mark it was well acted and well directed giving you a view of history that some non-sports fans will enjoy the historic factor alone gives it a high rating the brookline golf course was really done well i am in the northeast and have seen brookline as a fan and as someone who loves the game the movie was well done on all levels a must see 5 stars the acting was superb disney has another winner in its bag of great movies if for no other reason watch the film to give hope and encouragement to young people whom may not see the hope in their life i would tell you that the setting while in the late 1800 's and early 1900 's is very realistic the costumes and dialect were right on the mark as well above and beyond the call of duty for a golf film a must see for fans and non-fans alike,1
this movie ... i saw it 15 years ago and in the last years could n't remember it any more name or anything else just it was about a romanian country man played superbly by anthony quinn the impression i got from this drama will be eternal finally i found the name of the movie i hope i will be able to buy it and honestly this movie worth 10 oscars ten times bravo i was quite young when i first saw the movie i asked my friends if they heard about this story but nobody would know anything about anthony quinn playing the role of a romanian peasant i remember when a german officer came and saw anthony and told him he was a good `` breed '' but in fact the german was cheating on him for few bucks you wo n't get rich in case you buy the movie but you will be rich if you have it,1
just about everything in this movie is wrong wrong wrong take mike myers for example he 's reached the point where you realize that his shtick has n't changed since his snl days over ten years ago he 's doing the same cutesy stream-of-consciousness jokes and the same voices his cat is painfully unfunny he tries way to hard he 's some weird type a comedian not the cool cat he 's supposed to be the rest of the movie is just as bad the sets are unbelievably ugly -- and clearly a waste of millions of dollars cardboard cut-outs for the background buildings would have made more sense than constructing an entire neighborhood and main street alec balwin tries to do a funny great santini impression but he ends up looking and sounding incoherent there 's even an innapropriate cheesecake moment with faux celebrity paris hilton -- that sticks in the mind simply because this is supposed to be a dr. seuss story avoid this movie at all costs folks it 's not even an interesting train wreck i hope they 'll make horton hears a who with robin williams then we 'll have the bad-seuss movie-starring-spasitc- comedian trilogy,0
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage i saw `` capturing the friedmans '' a short while ago and have to admit i thought this was better the story is not an incredibly shocking one but it is a great examination of trapped personalities and relational cold war block deftly guides the viewer through diaries family footage and after-the-fact interviews his interview style is sensitive and probing and his insights are clear and measured 51 birch street is a great examination of personalities and relationships over 40-50 years of social change the social fallout and potential for redemption,1
i 'd never walked out of a movie before this one i 'd entertained the idea a couple of times but this time i did it snuck in to see the end of another movie but had to come back and see the end of the rage while i waited for my friends they told me i did n't miss much while i was gone either i was generally offended by the entire movie in such a grand way that i ca n't even describe it my gut instinct told me to get myself out of the theatre it was a visceral reaction to a horrible movie the plot centered around the cruel actions of some reprehensible teenagers against vulnerable and troubled others there was no ray of light no resonsible or likeable person to provide contrast i found that even the `` good guys '' of the movie did nothing for me were silly stupid whiney or just plain ineffectual the repetitious graphic suicide imagery was way overdone unnecessary and disgusting not in a `` i 'm easily grossed out '' way but more in the portrayal of disregard for humanity way and besides the repetition of that scene in slow motion from so many angles the other visual aspects interesting camera work etc had potential but just became annoying sometimes i am a person who loves movies and tries to find good things about them usually i can find some good things to counterbalance the not-so-good of any movie i 'm not saying that this movie had nothing good but i am saying that whatever that may have been i ca n't remember it with all the other crap that drove me mad i 'm really sorry about that too maybe the best parts were the clips from the classic original,0
i found this movie to be quite enjoyable and fairly entertaining good characters good actors and enough suspense to keep your interest throughout the plot twists might have been a bit much but overall a decent thriller if you liked this film i would recommend the spanish prisoner the house of games and no way out,1
the beginning of this movie had me doubting that it would be little more than a typical b sci-fi flick but as it progressed i began to get interested and i saw the whole thing through the premise is interesting original and has the makings of making a classic alas it instead ended up a mediocre movie done in by the usual factors which turn a potentially good movie into a bad movie bad acting low budget etc. i 'm interested to see how this would turn out if it were remade with good actors and a big hollywood budget,0
ghost story has an interesting feminist revenge tale premise a-list veteran actors colorful flashbacks with nifty look-a-like youthful counterparts of the old men scary staccato music heralding the approaching horrors atmospheric new england winter weather and an excellent charismatic actress in the title role ghost story could have been much more effective in black and white and in eliminating some of the more lurid special effects and to presenting a more cogent screenplay we should not have to be wondering about why the two trailer-parkish acolytes are in the script the biggest detriment of the film is craig wassan definitely separated at birth from bill maher who from perhaps editing or just bad acting is totally ineffective he seems to `` specialize '' in wide-eyed wide-mouthed reaction shots not a lot of personality here the revelation however is alice krige pale-faced enigmatic terrifying underneath the placid exterior however her eva galli is creepy even before she meets her fate i mean a young woman who says things like `` i 'd like to take a bite out of you '' or `` dance with me you little toad '' is already not in the land of the living ghost story would have been much better in a low-key val lewton mode the overdone special effects completely undercut the chill factor,0
andy lau and lau ching-wan are both superb in johnny to 's tautly directed crime thriller which puts most western efforts to shame think of it as the hong kong 'heat only better everything about the film screams class from the performances to the soundtrack the cinematography to the script the tone remains serious throughout but the film has a nice line in black-humour friendship and romance at it 's heart sure it gets a little preposterous later on but it would be a hard-hearted viewer who did n't find something to love about this movie thank god hollywood has n't yet re-made and ruined a classic do yourself a favour and see this film,1
this movie reminds me of 'eternal sunshine of the spotless mind and 'garden state not because of content but because it is one of those movies that you do n't hear about except through word of mouth or you read the back of the dvd at the video store and think `` why not '' needless to say i was pleasantly surprised like the aforementioned films at how good it was and how much i enjoyed it best seen with little knowledge of the movie and with only intrigue guiding you to actually watch it also best seen with someone else or if you know someone else that has seen it you will want to talk about it it 's a beautiful film that stays with you well after you watch it it 's also an intelligent watch that requires little effort into figuring out parts for yourself just enjoy,1
i know this film has had a fairly rough ride from the critics but i have to say that i thoroughly enjoyed it the real star here is the fantastic dylan moran he never fails to be both hilarious and convincing in all of his varied disguises he also manages to radiate a sweet charm that belies his outrageous pratfalls special mention must also go to michael gambon who plays for laughs with a brilliantly accurate and yet comedic inner city dublin accent the only weak link is caine who while obviously having a great laugh hamming it up plays the least interesting and most unsympathetic character it probably wo n't play that well overseas but it 's well worth a watch all the same,1
there is n't much that comes close to the perfect-paced storytelling and suspenseful action-packed levels as `` goldeneye '' when it came out it was the greatest game of all-time and even today it stays strong i will admit that this game did get boring after a few months of playing and by not playing it again until two years later i was thrust back into its greatest almost as if i was playing it for the first time again there are 20 action-packed levels which is probably the most of any james bond game to date probably the most unforgettable one is the tank level which was likely the most explosive video game sequence at that time and the first-person shooting as well as usage of q gadgets is what james bond fans are always dying to use frankly as a james bond fan i look for aspects of a true james bond experience which are now showing up in the ps2 games so this game while it has some great action and usable gadgets i was somewhat expecting a little more even back in 1997. i also disliked that this game did n't have q or m or moneypenny or anyone from mi6 while watching the movies bond interacts with these characters at least a few times throughout each movie but they are nowhere to be seen in this game and vocal dialogue would have made the game more lively rather than the text dialogue they wound up using they had the technology they just did n't use it probably the most annoying feature of this game is that in some ways it follows the story of the movie precisely and other ways it 's incoherent for example there are two many levels where you have to protect or save natalya even though in the movie she can take care of herself there are also some unnecessary levels like the boat level where you have to disarm some bombs which is not in the movie which adds nothing to the storyline whatsoever there are even some levels where you rescue natalya but at the beginning of the next level she 's captured again how oh well even those little things ca n't really put this game down and while i do prefer the newer games this bond experience is definitely one you wo n't forget 8 out of 10,1
i have seen this movie only once several years ago but i remember liking it a lot spoilers ahead an old famous opera singer is retired and she decides to give all the money she has to her cats her butler hears this and plots to get rid of the cats so he can have the fortune he puts knockout drops in their milk when they wake up they find themselves miles away they must journey back to their house before it is too late with the help of an independent-minded tomcat and other animal accomplices while evading the butler and foiling his plan could have been better but it also could have been a lot worse my score 7/10,1
in 1983 two bond movies was made one was the official bond movie octopussy starring roger moore who starred as james bond for the first time in live and let die and the other was the unofficial bond movie never say never again starring sean connery who played the role as james bond for the first time in dr. no that film was also the first 007 james bond movie to be made never say never again is called unofficial because the company that made the other james bond movies did n't make this one never say never again is also a remake of the 1965 007 movie thunderball there are several differences in never say never again that lets you know it was n't made by eon one thing is that the opening is different there 's no gun barrel sequence and no pre-credit sequence another difference is the music score some things in this movie does feel like a james bond movie like the gadgets and cars plus james bond always getting it on with the ladies and the film does have an opening credits song sean connery still does a great job playing bond the acting from the other stars is also great never say never again is a good film that 's just has entertaining as the official james bond films check this out 10/10,1
anatomie was a german made movie and subtitled.it was also overlong and boring.if it was supposed to be a horror movie it failed miserably for me.the actors went through their paces looking more like they wanted to be some where else.the film work was ok but more attention should have been applied to the awful banal script.i paid nothing to see the video and i still feel cheated.go read a book and save your money,0
if you have ever shopped at wal-mart then you probably know about the 5 dvd bin that sits by the electronics department well that is where i found this movie however i was tricked you see the cover of this particular dvd had a big picture of sandy bullock on it and even listed her name as a `` headliner '' i picked it up thinking `` wow i did n't know sandra bullock did this movie '' so i was pumped to go home and watch a cool sandra bullock movie much to my surprise ms. bullock had a small role ..... very small role she plays the girlfriend of the son of the cia agent talk about supporting actress she may have had no more than 2 lines in the movie besides being deceived of this being a bullock flick i looked past that and i continued to watch an `` action-packed '' film negative at one point for special effects a gun was taped to the camera you got ta watch it to laugh at what horrible really is,0
apart from the beautiful imagery thanks to new zealand cinematographer alun bollinger this film is not worth seeing the storyline is so fragmented and lost that it 's hard to know what is going on at any given time and just when you think you 're following then the direction changes again like a lost bi-polar puppy dog the musical score is awful relying too heavily on extremely emotive pieces that try to force the audience into feeling a certain way as if the instruments were acting as an emotions queue sheet  'feel sad here 'feel shocked here 'feel scared here on top of that the repetitive samples used over and over again leave the audience on the verge of laughter gone are the days of silent film where musical instruments were the sole portrayal of voice  but you would n't think so while watching river queen the voice-over was so over-utilised that one has to wonder if this film really even needed any accompanying imagery it could have easily been a radio play although even then it would be hard to follow the story and the stolen ideas from jane campion 's the piano are too obvious to overlook not only are the beach and forest shots almost identical to those in the piano  perhaps some of this comes down to alun bollinger 's camera work on the latter  but the voice-over feeling and levels too are strikingly close and who could forget when holly hunter 's character has her wings clipped in the form of her index finger being cut off by sam neill does it remind you of when wiremu has his 'trigger finger amputated and surprisingly too with an axe i thought so all in all i can not recommend this film for viewing unless you wear some ear-muffs and just go with the scenery in mind,0
louis khan was one of the most influential architects of our time and this film speaks volumes about how little everyone really knew his son 's desire to find out who and more importantly what he was is moving and emotional this film captures the spirit of what architecture is really about what good design is and the emotional price that is paid for it equally haunting is the sound track if you see the film and then listen to the sound track you can revisit the film simply by listening as a practicing architect of over 30 years my heart ached and rejoiced over the film and its very straight forward albeit emotional honesty and sincerity i had the honor of seeing this film previewed in chicago at the national convention of the american institute of architects the film was introduced by daniel and he was kind enough to do a question and answer session afterward during the entire presentation of the film not a sound not a cough not one distraction took place the entire audience sat mesmerized and the real treat was daniel 's mother was present during the showing of the film i will always remember the film and play it over constantly in my mind every time i listen to the soundtrack ...,1
john huston actor and director better known for more robust fare such as `` the misfits '' and `` african queen '' directs his daughter angelica huston in what would be his last film indeed the film was released after huston 's death based on james joyce 's novella of the same name `` the dead '' tells the quiet story of a new year 's celebration in 1904 dublin huston his cast and his screenwriters including his son tony have created a gem of a movie the novella is among joyce 's finest works as well as being the only one that is filmable the film is a tribute to huston 's genius he has taken a small beautiful story and has made a small beautiful movie donal mccann and angelica huston shine although `` shine '' is too showy too flashy a word to describe their quiet understated performances `` the dead '' reflects the huston family 's love for ireland and is in its own quiet way a fitting final movie for a legend,1
i heard an interview with the main actor who said that the film was not intended to be a horror movie but he himself would describe it as mental horror i strongly subscribe to that it is not clear why he travels to this place but everything there is monotonous no bright colors no honest smiles nothing personal everything is ordered and everyone seems to be satisfied living this kind of life our `` hero '' though from the beginning seems to be misplaced and feels it himself what makes this film so important and good is the remarkable similarity to life in many large cities or even countries nowadays you have to function you are not supposed to let your colleague know your weaknesses you show off on your wealth your car etc. and most of all you lack the true love of life that children have naturally in this film you see neither children nor old people they simply do not fit in a society of strong workers i would recommend this film to everyone and make sure that this utopia does not come true,1
had it not been for to kill a mockingbird this movie would be much more famous had it not been for gregory peck as addicus fitch the acting here would be much more lauded had it not been for william faulkner perhaps to kill a mockingbird might never have been written in his shadow i found this movie to be sadly familiar because it showed me that one of my favorite movies to kill a mockingbird may not have been as original as i 'd always thought it was perhaps it was inspired by this very similar movie oh the `` whodunnit '' is different but the underlying story a lone righteous `` white '' attorney against a white southern town defending a black man is all too familiar and written by a woman mockingbird concentrates on rape the ultimate betrayal to a woman while this movie concentrates on brother against brother hatred the rape a man feels by fraternal betrayal there 's not the depth of mockingbird here not the comfort that addicus brings with his presence so you 're just left with the sadness that whether she intended to lift the plot from this movie or not harper lee 's mockingbird reflects nothing changed in that 10 or so years since the time she may have read faulkner 's book and saw his movie while in college in alabama and unconsciously or not took most of it as her own in later years nothing changed in race relations and some may say nothing has changed even now these many years later it 's all too sadly familiar and one wishes there were an addicus of our day to make it all right where mockingbird leaves you with hope of that rocking in the arms of addicus and waiting for a morning of better times this movie leaves you just sad that pride from black people might equal or better the pride of white people but pride from either is no answer at all rather it 's the answer of addicus we need comfort that we are all flawed and that in our frailty we should have mercy not pride when facing each other in our differences,1
the acrobatics mixed with haunting music make one spectacular show the costumes are vibrant and the performances will just boggle your mind simply amazing,1
i only saw the first part of this and concluded that i would n't miss anything if i did n't watch the second episode the cinematography was ok but apart from this the plot was just as commonorgarden and run-of-the-mill as any other war story the actors and actresses play their characters without any passion and the make up is really bad heiner lauterbach with his white hair and kai wiesinger respectively as if some dyed white hair could give them more dignity and common sense i mean if you 've watched more than two or three movies about wwii as most of us have then you 'd only go to the trouble of seeing a third or fourth one if it promises some new insights or twists in the plot but roland suso richter seems to afraid of doing so you can almost smell his fear of not living up to the bourgeois and jejune expectations of the conservative zdf tv channel while watching this movie millions of euros were spent to perpetuate boring and unimaginative german film-making these millions of dollars could have been spent to make three or four independent movies but no let 's give to some director who 'll make a film that tells people that war can be explained by rational means my advice read joseph heller or kurt vonnegut instead they 'll tell you what war is like or give me one million euros and i make a better film than this load of bs and another thing why is it that german movies only get to be nominated for the oscars when the movie deals with wwii or the holocaust probably because that is the only thing german film-making is good at and that should get us thinking should n't it,0
for all intents and purposes showtime was the worst movie i have ever seen why because having deniro in the cast adds immediate credibility and makes you want to watch the movie i had also made the mistake of watching 48 hours and beverly hills cop recently before seeing showtime and for some strange reason thought eddie murphy was still funny well he 's not in fact it almost seems like he has been neutered as i watched this movie i was in amazement that deniro decided this was a good enough script to lend his name too no chemistry between him and murphy whatsoever horrible writing horrible jokes a movie that you think is supposed to be good ca n't get much worse than this not too long after sitting through the wretch that was showtime i happened to watch national security starring martin lawrence the movie had its funny parts but was n't that great but still it was 20 times better than showtime please if your a deniro fan do not watch this movie,0
this is a finely crafted movie with moving sequences humor and best of all a love story anthony quinn is wonderfully casted and after seeing several of his movies this has to be categorized as one of his best performances besides zorba the movie makes you really wonder if its filmed in romania which apparently is not the case it is sure to fool even native romanians with its authentic-like landscape costume and ways of life according to imdb it is actually shot in france and yugoslavia hmmm the story is compelling making you want to watch the entire movie over to see if you missed something it provoked me into researching to find out if this is a truth based movie but to my disappointment it is a novel based film seemingly fiction it seems a bit far fetched to have happened for real but one never knows .... the one problem with this film is that it does n't seem to cast any romanian actors and it is a film about a romanian character there are probably many romanian fill-ins in the beginning but maybe not it is filmed elsewhere the author of the book was romanian at least thats all fine and dandy overall a masterpiece in cinematography,1
`` talk radio '' is my favorite oliver stone movie though he has made many great ones including `` salvador '' `` jfk '' `` natural born killers '' and `` platoon '' but i like the intimacy of `` talk radio '' a cinematic expansion of eric bogosian 's searing stage play that was based on a real life account of a dallas talk show host working with ace cinematographer robert richardson stone turns what could have been a very set-bound exercise into a visually arresting ideological battle that presents a radio station as an arena of war bogosian is devastating as tortured on-air spouter of abuse barry champlain and conveys the conflicted destructive nature of his character with conviction and a generous dose of self-loathing alec baldwin as his alpha male boss strikes the perfect note as a man driven nuts by a guy whose monstrousness he helped nurture ellen greene is fantastic as barry 's sweet ex-wife who ends up becoming another target of his vicious personal vitriol stone and bogosian fill every frame with interest and every line of dialog with sweet poison and cutting ambiguity john c. mcginley as barry 's long-suffering screener/technical producer stu turns in a hilarious sharp performance as does the great michael wincott the film is a flawless underrated masterpiece of superb writing awesome acting and brutal uncompromising direction the stewart copeland score is brilliant too,1
i thought it was weird and just gory not scary i have seen a couple of the japanese horror films ringu and juon and loved them but this movie was a disappointment it never even explained anything about the curse i just did n't see any horror ... it was n't scary to me at all the whole time i was watching i was waiting for kirie to discover the secret of the curse and why it was happening now if this was some ancient curse why did n't it happen before shuichi 's father and it never told us what happened to her father i kept waiting for someone to tell us the meaning or the reasoning behind this curse and then it just ended i was very disappointed,0
paul rudnick jeffrey addams family values wrote this frothy tale of a mild mannered school teacher kevin kline who is outted on the academy awards by a former student-turned-actor matt dillon the rest of the film deals with the absurdities revolving around this setup -the effect on the town his fiancee joan cusack himself- and climaxes with an everybody-loves-everybody finale if you 're an angry gay rights activist or a naive youth looking for an accurate portrayal of a man 's struggle to come out or a 'true depiction of gay life then save yourself the trouble and rent something else maybe beautiful thing or read a book giovanni 's room if you are able to understand that this film was inspired by the piousness of tom hanks 's speech on the academy awards when he won for philadelphia and pokes fun at hollywood culture and small town ignorance and you have a fondness for '30 's screwball comedy bringing up baby holiday the palm beach story then enjoy far from being a biting satire the film tries for the exuberance of a preston sturges farce and comes damn close no it 's not 'deep or 'powerful -neither were romy michelle 9 to 5 or young frankenstein- and it does n't pretend to be it keeps it 's tongue-firmly-in-cheek it gets too preachy and maudlin for its own good toward the end and sure some of the jokes are a bit stale there 's also a locker room scene that could have been cut but after sitting through countless comedies that misfire it 's like a breath of fresh air kevin kline and tom selleck are wonderfully game while debbie reynolds and wilford brimley add fine support the excellent joan cusack 's award winning performance is stellar and the great bob newhart is well bob newhart the fact that many have been offended by in out is as absurd as the mentality of the townsfolk it pokes fun at personally i was more offended by philadelphia i 'll take harmless fluff over sanctimoniousness anytime,1
while on vacation on northern australia gracie diana glenn her husband adam andy rodoreda and her younger sister lee maeve dermody decide to take the blackwater barry tour in the swamp for fishing their guide jim ben oxenbould uses a small motor boat and takes the tourist along the river to a remote spot when they stop they are attacked by a huge crocodile that capsizes their boat and immediately kills jim the three survivors climb a tree and when they realize that help would never come to rescue them they decide to try to find a way out of their sheltered location however in the muddy water their boat is flipped and the crocodile stalks the trio under the water `` black water '' is a tense realistic and dramatic low-budget movie and in accordance with the warning in the beginning based on a true event the acting of the unknown diana glenn maeve dermody and andy rodoreda is top-notch giving credibility to this simple but scary story there are many similarities between this movie and `` prey '' but in different environments my vote is seven title brazil `` medo profundo '' `` deep fear '',1
the movie started off o.k a couple of tourists on vacation in mexico having a good time decide they should go on a hike they uncover some hidden trails and end up and this huge temple like fortress angry villagers show up and try to deter them from climbing it but because of the language barrier people get shot and the tourists end up climbing the stupid thing turns out the plants are evil blood-thirsty things that the villagers wo n't go near so they guard the temple so the tourists ca n't get off there are a couple of scares in this movie but nothing really makes sense i mean they 're plants do n't bother buying or renting the d.v.d wait till it comes out on cable,0
when nathaniel kahn embarked into this voyage he hardly knew who his father really was by the end of the film he found him and comes to terms with the strange life he lived as a child louis kahn was the father he was an architect 's architect his designs were perhaps too complex as he tried to create buildings that did n't conform with trends popular at that time it is ironic that he never achieved the fame that came so easy to some of his contemporaries he had a vision and he never strayed from it we can see characteristics of his unique style in the buildings he left behind as a legacy to humanity every one of his creations are unique in that they do n't imitate works from other architects louis kahn 's life was rather complicated he was married yet he had affairs with two of his assistants that produced a girl and a boy besides the legitimate daughter he had with his wife as a boy nathaniel kahn 's life was lived in a secluded area away from his father who only visited late at night louis kahn never recognized these children although it is very clear they all knew about the others existence it is tragic that louis kahn died alone in grand central station when he was returning from a trip without making peace with the women and children he never acknowledged as his own by his side he probably cared a great deal about all his children but he remains an aloof figure throughout the film we never get to know the man although at the end nathaniel in his quest to discover his father 's life finds most of the missing pieces of the puzzle this is a personal account on the life of an artist thanks to that son who has the courage to tell the story we are almost prying into the lives of louis kahn and his extended family,1
renoir 's tale of paris the cancan a washer-girl and the moulin rouge.a more subdued but highly entertaining version of the opening of the moulin rouge jean gabin gives his usual excellent performance.the technicolor photography on the print i saw was exquisite.an easy evening 's viewing chris w galla,1
first of all i have nothing against christianity i believe every person has the right to believe what he or she chooses but i can not imagine how dumb a person has to be to believe this what a waste of believers money they 'd better use it to feed some starving families in the third world countries i do n't want to talk about talk acting or plot of this `` movie '' because i could n't find any of those in this story 's simple two reporters one a is atheist the other b for some sake has abandoned religion b regains his confidence in religion and teaches a a lesson believe in christ or go to hell this message appears after like ten minutes and keeps repeating to the end of the movie people do not believe the rating of this `` movie '' read reviews first i did n't and wasted an hour of my life ps why is it classified as sci-fi because of those few weird sounds and a bit of bright light from the sky pps u.f.o satan 's evil doings that 's a new one,0
first i have to say that i really love udo kier and have always had respect for armand assante but nothing could save this train wreck of a movie udo does not even appear till much later in the movie and the acting from everyone is just terrible the script is all over the place the dialog is wooden the `` action '' is laughable and the plot could be summed up on a dirty cocktail napkin i really wanted to find something redeeming in this movie but found myself holding my hands over my eyes shaking my head and repeating over and over to myself `` oh udo ..... why .... why .. '' if you are a fan of udo or armand please do n't watch this movie it will only make you sad for them,0
after watching this film i decided that it was so awful that i must join imdb and write a review to warn other people of the pit falls of renting/buying this film to be fair to the film there is only one good section to this film and that is the end credits cause then you know that this crap is well and truly over i watched it to the end in the hope that i may get a little bit of pleasure out of the film just tunnels more tunnels and an old man talking to himself if you watch this film too many time so will you as for val if he keeps selecting films like this he may as well kiss goodbye to his acting career there is no point in even writing about what is in the film as that has already been done keep your money and sanity and keep well clear,0
the plot involves a new hipper franchise barbershop that is moving across the street from calvin 's barbershop so he feels like he has to change and improve his shop by getting newer stuff and such sounds real exciting huh as for the rest of the film a lot of it involves the same material from the first film the people that work at calvin 's stand around talk loud and mouth off to each other and the customers once again cedric the entertainer was mildly funny but it is more like he 's doing a stand-up routine than anything to do with the movie and calvin is faced with another moral issue involving taking a large sum of money he 's already shown that he will do the right thing in the end final verdict nothing new i do n't recommend it unless you thought the first barbershop was the best thing since sliced bread,0
poorly done political actioner badly photographed acted and directed every single scene is underlighted including those very few that are shot during the daytime it does n't matter what the location is at an important conference in the white house no lights are on and the only available lighting is a gloomy blue that is filtered through a few windows the primier of china conducts an earth-shattering phone conversation under conditions of such intense chiaroscuro that he should be contemplating a bust of homer in a rembrandt painting honest it 's as if he had a tiny spotlight on his face and was otherwise in total darkness the slow motion deaths are by now obligatory in any ill-thought-out movie roy scheider and maria conchita alonzo do well by their roles but scheider is rarely on screen the other performances are dismissable there is a pretty oriental woman in a short tight skirt who totes a gun and is right out of a bond movie who 's accent suggests a childhood spent in basset nebraska and who should have remained the model she probably started out as whoever plays the surviving secret service agent aboard the cruise ship was probably picked for the part because he looked most like johnny depp not because of any display of talent the chinese villains representing both taiwan and mainland china hiss and grin as they threaten the heroes the script is pretty awful recycled from other better films there is a lot of shooting aboard the ship and practically everyone winds up mincemeat two thirds of the way through the ship explodes into the expected series of fireballs then the movie splits into two related parts part one another shootout this time in a waterfront warehouse part two an exchange between the vice president now acting president and the oily chinese premiere lifted out of both `` dr. strangelove '' and `` fail safe '' we unwittingly launch our missiles they launch theirs in retaliation we can not convince them that our launch was accidental even though we offer to help them destroy our own missiles there is even the george c. scott/ walter matthau general who argues that their `` nucular '' armory ca n't match ours so we should hit them with everything we 've got more fireballs the end comes none too soon,0
i have always been a fan of the show so i 'll admit that i am biased when the show 's run ended i felt like too many questions remained unanswered this movie to me felt like closure to see all the people i 'd followed over the past few years together at last was most rewarding i have heard that this is probably the only homicide movie that we can expect if that is so this is the appropriate way to go out this movie is sometimes poignant sometimes upsetting but always satisfying if you are or ever have been a fan of the show watch this movie,1
unlike the previous poster i liked the celluloid treatment it looked good and made the movie that much more enjoyable to watch to me it did n't detract at all from the power of the documentary 's content in fact i felt the slickness of the look allowed me to just lose myself that much more in the content the previous poster was fair to liken the style to a nike commercial it definitely has that look but for my tastes it worked really well and i am far from a fan of nike commercials in my opinion this is how documentary film-making should be done i ca n't wait to see the next installments from these promising filmmakers,1
i have to ask myself do movies like this get their support by people associated with the movie itself coming here and critiquing it how can something so awful score this high my parents went to see a lot of the more adult themed movies when we were kids anything with an r in it until we were old enough i only remember two films that had them saying yech when they got home this one and `` catch-22 '' the movie is comprised of bumbling physicians and staff in a filthy hospital rambling narratives and a pack of inner city people who look like rejects from a 1970s norman lear sitcom staging a protest the worst part is the `` murder mystery '' a crazy old guy doing `` god 's work '' by killing doctors and others when he confesses scott and his girlfriend show little emotion they only care about him getting out of there where he will `` be safe and happy '' a doctor that drops dead of a heart attack is faked as the man so he can get away oh my what a fun movie this movie did n't `` make me think '' chuckle or have any other feeling other than `` it must get better '' but it never does people wonder why it was a failure no wonder here i wonder how imdb has enough members that think this movie is good yech,0
imagine an exploitive remake of the defiant ones with a black chick and a white chick attached to each other set the story on some caribbean island where the drug dealers rule and the revolution has arrived and have the black woman be from huggy bear 's stable of ladies and the white woman be a watered down patty hearst and you 've got black mama white mama in those waning days of the drive-in theater this item must have been a big old hit all the hot buttons of the seventies are pushed in this one even though they both fill out their clothes better and will get a few whistles from the males in the audience no one is ever going to mistake pam grier and margaret markov for sidney poitier and tony curtis all right halle berry and jamie lee curtis margaret and pam are prisoners where the guards and the warden look lasciviously at the new fish arriving margaret is a rich girl from the state who took up 'the revolution whilst pam 's your basic high priced call girl who 's been servicing the local drug kingpin and grew tired of it and tried to leave the island margaret 's fellow revolutionaries ambush the bus transporting them from the women 's prison to town but they get lost in the escape both have their different agendas but like sid and tony they ca n't quite agree on whose agenda comes first makes for some interesting times as the police the drug dealers and the revolutionaries are all looking for these two illfated chain buddies just so you do n't get any wrong ideas the head of the revolutionaries and markov 's kanoodling partner is named ernesto played by filipino actor zaldy zshornack the whole mess was shot in the phillipines who were getting their own film industry started nice location photography in the phillipines is all that black mama white mam has to recommend it but if you 're a fan of really bad black exploitation flicks this is one for you,0
this film promises much but delivers little the basic problem has to do with the inclusion of charlotte gainsbourg 's character in this film immigrants from sicily did not need a redheaded anglo in any way -- the movie may have needed her but new citizens certainly did not in my opinion the decision to include her destroys the continuity of the film this is particularly troubling since it seems to demean not only the characters in the movie but also the history of immigration itself immigrants themselves were heroic figures fully capable of getting along without having to satisfied what i believer to be a veiled image of `` the white man 's burden '' i wonder if someone will make a movie of irish immigrants which will include a sicilian woman as a major character the left elbow index considers seven aspects of film -- acting production sets dialogue artistry film continuity plot and character development -- on a scale from high of 10 for excellent 5 for average and 1 for needs help both film continuity and plot rate a low of 1. the continuity as discussed above is further degraded by the surrealistic ending does not a film of such important historical significance deserve more than a conclusion which reminds one of marc chagall the plot is simple enough until it seems to become entangled with too much time in the old country too little time on the ship and too much emphasis on the ending the acting and character development is average since all the characters are fixed throughout the film and the inclusion of the anglo-saxon speaking perfect english almost turns the movie into a satire where 's groucho when you need him the production sets the dialogue and the artistry are very good each rating a 10. the sets in sicily on the ship and on ellis island are as good as one can find the dialogue is marvelous and the ethic singing is superb i agree with scorsese that listening to the sicilian dialect is a pleasure note that the immigrants speak of `` america '' not the `` united states '' -- the ideal vs. the political reality the are many good artistic scenes with dreams of america gold coins raining and giant veggies among the best the average left elbow index is 5.25 raised to a 7.0 when equated with the imdb scale one other notion seems to run through ellis island experience the tribulations of pass immigrants was grueling later in 2006 one only had to pay a coyote or boat owner and sneak into the county under the darkness of night no questions asked the movie is worth seeing but it appears that what one sees is problematical,1
this film features two of my favorite guilty pleasures sure the effects are laughable the story confused but just watching hasselhoff in his knight rider days is always fun i especially like the old hotel they used to shoot this in it added to what little suspense was mustered give it a 3,0
susan sarandon and natalie portman play adele and ann august a single mother who 's the working definition of the word `` dreamer '' and her solemn pragmatic daughter adele wanting to make a fresh start in a big city moves them from wisconsin to california decent if not exceptional or particularly memorable with some serious and sad moments it pushes some emotional buttons that 's for sure best thing it offers is a solid cast and sarandon and portman are quite good in the leads even if their characters are one-dimensional at times could be better could be worse i gave this one seven out of ten,1
a beautiful magical thought-provoking and heart-warming story excellent direction perfect cast marvellous script excellent score beautifully lit ...... need i say more if you love films that not only make you think but also warm your heart some that spring to mind are 'contact 'field of dreams and 'groundhog day then you 're sure to love k-pax most highly recommended,1
this was one of the slowest movies i have ever had the displeasure of sitting through after the introduction where we are given the backstory of `` something '' killing a couple people in a farm house we are introduced to a white looser family that is moving to a farm and nothing happens for a looooong time then they meet this drifter who helps out on the farm and nothing happens again for a very long time then finally the girl of the family has some plotergeist stuff happens then some more happens the drifter guy goes nuts and the movie ends in between its all about how this family had to move out becuz the girl got in some trouble back home and they have no money and its done so poorly that i could care less about these pathetic people i can not believe i actually went to the theatres to see this not only did this movie suck but some a hole answered his cell phone dumb morons were making noise and the movie sucked thats why theaters suck bad movies overpriced crappy food and idiots in the theatre i 'm staying home and watching dvds from now on at least i could smoke if i was at home while watching this stupid movie stay home and bake some pie rather than going to a theatre to see this piece of typical crap dumb stupid crap,0
this movie is engaging from start to finish with excellent performances a great soundtrack with original music by douglas brown and a well paced script that 's full of surprises full of new and not so new faces this movie showcases promising talent especially in the case of craig morris who plays the main character eddie monroe morris who also co-wrote the script displays a quiet strength combined with a strong emotional performance as he creates a believable character on screen also a poignant delivery by paul vario who plays uncle benny with a genuine warmth was so convincing that he made me hungry as he lovingly prepared his italian sauce great new faces great new music and a great new story what more could you ask for this film is highly recommended,1
a snore gore i saw this piece of horrible stinking worthless junk at the cameo movie house now the famous crobar night-club on washington avenue on south beach in 1980 or 81. i was 17 and my three buddies and i laughed at this horrible gross piece of trash the theater was on it 's last legs and there were mostly drunks snoring and sleeping in the place they did n't miss a darn thing the worst acting ever.these actors deserve the academy award for the worst and i mean worst acting roles in the history of the cinema joke was the theater was showing another mi mi lay a great name at least stinker ... barf city enough said if you 're under 12 years old you might get a few chills over 12 you will be snoring after the opening credits it 's just amazing that anyone spent a cent on making this movie and to think it 's considered a `` cult '' classic yuk,0
ok everybody is so enthused by this film i hardly dare add a negative review but i just did not enjoy this movie i have to say first i saw the film in russian language overdub so i will have missed some dialog but not much nice things first there are some hilarious moments the elvis impersonator for instance actors seem well casted also the russians efremova is great and goldblum is very good which brings us to the downsides of this movie first of all there is hardly any story and the end we know already yeltsin wins so no drama or suspense they tried to solve this problem with an emerging affair between the actors mentioned above but that story kind of evaporates more importantly the film does not represent reality the russians at the level of politics and society portrayed in this movie are not funny they are a serious and dangerous lot i am willing to believe that flying in some spin-doctors from the states helped yeltsin win his campaign but the real interesting questions that should be addressed are who financed the campaign what did they get in return how was the opposition handled apart from airing some commercials so what we have here is a film loosely based on reality but strangely avoiding anything that could make the film either historically relevant or just a very good political thriller without plot or subplot,0
at one time buddy cop movies ruled the box office it seemed that every summer flocks of beverly hills cop wannabes descended on our nation 's theaters not any more lately the gusher has dried to barely a trickle the drought has eased a bit recently with the release of showtime a movie that is a genuinely funny and consistently entertaining example of the genre mitch preston is a dedicated cop he 's not a dirty harry type by any means he 's just incredibly focused professional who 's completely intolerant of anything that gets in the way of the performance of his duties like say a t.v cameraman mitch deals with the cameraman in a socially irresponsible way and so falls into the clutches of chase renzi a producer looking for a killer hook for her reality t.v cop show she thinks that mitch will give her the edgy boost it needs to be a hit but feels he may be too unlikable to carry the whole show by himself enter trey sellars a patrolman-cum-actor who 's watched way too many police story re-runs of course mitch and trey mix like oil and water and much merry mayhem ensues we know that mitch and trey are bound to become best buddies by the end of the movie that 's the way buddy-cop movies are suppose to work in fact it has to be said that showtime rarely deviates from the time-honored clichés as writ by lethal weapon and tango cash there 's a high tech mcguffin to get the ball rolling in this case an automatic rifle that fires rounds big enough to stop tanks there 's a slick foreign baddy with an accent of undetermined origin there are chases shootouts and explosions we all know this going in and we have a pretty fair idea how it 's all going to turn out you know what there 's nothing wrong with that yes we know the well-worn bases are going to be touched but the fun here is the trip not the destination showtime does n't strain to be original instead its energies are funneled into its characters and humorous situations as a result showtime does a competent job with the action sequences but really shines in its comedy robert de niro is dryly funny as mitch in the past i 've thought de niro to be a cold and unexpressive actor given horribly to mugging when called upon to do comedy lately though he 's grown on me he seems to be injecting more humanity into his roles eddie murphy is hilarious as trey the best way to describe his performance is that trey is what murphy would be if murphy were n't so talented and had n't hit the big time rene russo has a droll time playing motor-mouthed show biz shark chase renzi she stalks through the movie chasing high nielson ratings with awe-inspiring determination in her zeal she re-vamps mitch 's life to make it more camera friendly she even calls upon t. j. hooker himself william shatner to show mitch how be a more authentic cop shatner is funny playing himself precisely as we expect him to be loud oblivious and slightly obnoxious i have to admit i was really looking forward to showtime and i was n't disappointed ten years ago this movie would have been a guaranteed hit today it 's doing moderate business at best that 's a pity because showtime is a whole lot of fun,1
with matthias hues on the cover and only 3.00 i had to buy it i enjoyed some moments like hawks annoyance with the pleasure droids but i only really watched to see matthias hues scenes i particularly enjoyed the showdown at the end it was a cross between clint eastwood 's `` the good the bad and the ugly '' and `` for a few dollars more '' a 3 man quick-draw showdown with a musical pocket watch used as the countdown timer apart from that there 's really nothing more i can add the actors gave good performances all except the `` assassin droid '' whose performance was nothing outside of comical but the movie really lacked depth and purpose simply not enough to fill up 1hour and a half of standard movie time so we 're stuck with the main characters aimlessly wondering around from place to place for an hour or so until the ball gets rolling for example the main character returns to the same strip club about 4 times taking up two-fifths of the movie the scenery really lacked depth and creativity probably due to the films budget i do n't think we ever did get to see this `` perfect city '' of new angeles that was always talked about in fact when the main characters finally reached new angeles its set in a factory or warehouse full of pipes and walkways hardly the kind of `` kingdom '' the owner/creator of an entire city would dwell in the `` super-high security '' of new angeles was also always talked about but only a total of 15 maybe 20 security guards were counted even when the alarm went off not even close to matthias approximation of `` at least a hundred men out there '' if you are a fan of any of the actors/actresses in this film then you may want to watch it simply to `` add it to the list '' however if you value 1 and a half hour of your time or 3.00 of your money you may want to give this one a miss,0
one more classic performance by maniratnam and his team they can be proud to show this movie at all film festivals for it has got everything that needs to name it as an `` all time classic '' the war and its impacts in sri lanka through the eyes of a ten year old girl is the movie all about but the scenes and circumstances will surely be not the one that you will expect madhavan no wonder he is one of the best actors in the country who can always add beauty and unique identity for the role he plays and it needs real daringness to act as a father for three kids when he is considered as a dream boy with a glamorous personality in the industry music by ar rahman makes the movie a special one for those who love melodies above all the story and the way it is told makes it as the best movie in the recent times,1
i truly enjoyed this film it 's rare to find a star who can pull off the physical aspects of any sports/dance themed film convincingly and do a first rate acting job as well in this film you find two stars who rise to the occasion both women deliver warm touching and at times humorous performances the film also touched on a number of topics from racial issues to sexual identity and yet the approach was n't heavy handed the production values were also top notch for a small budget film i saw this at the philadelphia gay lesbian film festival and went back to see it a second time it was a real crowd pleaser everyone i spoke to seemed to enjoy this film,1
this takes place on fire island back in the 1970s a couple peter craig dudley and buddy j. will deane are throwing a 4th of july party at their house unfortunately their relationship is falling apart and they have to get ready for a house full of very strange guests the rest of the movie chronicles the party and what happens between peter and buddy ok -- i 'm a gay man but i was 8 back when this was made if this is a true view of what gay life was in the 1970s i 'm glad i was n't around from the puzzling opening credits which shows kids playing in the sand this movie slides slowly into disaster there 's a guru robert case who talks nonstop about nothing of any importance i wanted to gag the guy halfway into his first long speech there 's the young kid danny who is there for his first time there 's the lesbian couple who do nothing -- except one strips for no reason there 's the leather queen worst of all is the effeminate man named jimmy jimmy foster we 're introduced to him and his friend whose name i never got when they get a flat tire they basically scream and screech for 10 minutes and have no idea how to fix a flat i know some people find this funny but i found it offensive and pretty sad the party itself is full of people you would never want to know it 's like being dumped in a party full of bad actors playing obnoxious people with the sole exception of dudley no one can act this may be valuable as a portrait of what fire island was like in the 1970s ... but it 's pretty dull viewing this gets a 2 only for the frequent male nudity of some very nice bodies,0
this is the best french movie of the year i saw it twice and i found it great both times i did n't think it boring at all even though it is very long 3 hours i 'm seventeen so i obviously did n't get to live the events of may 1968 that marked an extremely important turn in french history but it does n't really matter since i still really enjoyed the film it 's actually quite universal people of my parents age can identify to the characters and so can people my age garrel seems to perfectly understand young people the way they think and the complications of love as well as the loss of illusions concerning the possibility of changing the world maybe that 's because the character played by louis garrel his son is actually meant to represent philippe garrel himself well anyway great movie no action have to be honest on that point but so strong feelings that you ca n't possibly stay indifferent to it if you 're looking for a relaxing sunday-evening movie do n't waste your time on this you 'll be disappointed but if you like cinema you 'll like les amants réguliers which is a bewitching movie close to those made in the 50 's and 60 's by the nouvelle vague artists,1
this is one odd film it seems to be aimed at a younger audience but is filled with sexual innuendos the whole premise is rather absurd not just the idea of some shrunken heads of three dead kids doing some crime fighting but the same said kids taking on a gang of tough older guys is a little far-fetched but then again the parents are mainly absent in the film and there is a lack of authority figures to keep the kids in line the cast are good though meg foster plays a very butch mafia-like leader with the handsome a.j damato as the leader of the bullies aerky egan and rebecca herbst are well cast as the young lovers though for a comic actress of her talent leigh allyn baker is notoriously wasted in this film overall the film is unusual but i do n't think that is enough to make up for the poor quality and bumbling execution the scenery is all rather dull and the `` special effects '' quite dismal sit this one out unless your in the mood,0
if this movie would have been in english all critics would have trashed it the language is extremely bad the scenes are awfully directed and it 's not at all funny after the movie i thought that this movie could have been written by an 8th grader at least if you consider the lack of believable characters and the fixation on certain male body parts oh on dogs as well ... the story is just plain nonsense compared to the more mature vingar av glas that premiered almost at the same time of course the public chose jalla jalla while vingar av glas got little attention what was really disturbing for me was the fact that the movie looked really bad that was probably due to the fact that first time director josef fares used really cheap camera equipment and then decided to just play around with it for fun i suppose the result however is a movie that can easily be split into 12 short films with a new directorial style in each one of them this was very frustrating maybe josef fares should have stayed with his short films since that seems to be the only art form he can master another disturbing fact is that the story does not hold together at several times in the middle of the movie the story has to move on very quickly and the characters then run into one another in a way that is just too unbelievable and then i have not mentioned the 2-dimensional characters especially those in the supporting roles even though i consider this one of the worst swedish films of the 90s as well as one of the most overrated it is kind of understandable that the public liked it i mean bad taste has always been the trademark of the masses ... i 'm more surprised that the critics enjoyed it they should have known better ... grade 2 of 10,0
my favourite police series of all time turns to a tv-film does it work yes gee runs for mayor and gets shot the homicide `` hall of fame '' turns up pembleton and nearly all of the cops who ever played in this series a lot of flashbacks helps you who hasn´t seen the tv-series but it amuses the fans too the last five minutes solves another murder and at the very end even two of the dead cops turn up and a short appearance from my favourite coroner juliana cox this is a good film,1
i would recommend this for anyone who is an admirer of the late john cassavetes and for those who have never known of cassavetes it is an excellent film i really do n't have the time to go into the details of why this is my opinion but if you 're looking for something gutsy with lots of scenes to mull over then this one is for you the cinematography is perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of the film as well as the story itself this `` review '' does not do the film justice it is an experience one must view for themselves lots of character very genuine,1
in a not totally successful attempt to be taken seriously and move into 'adult films mr. hughes gives us this film about a young married couple true it 's got every cliche in the book in it silly fantasy stuff and all that but more importantly- it 's got elizabeth mcgovern clearly the best actress to have ever appeared in a john hughes film she lends a weight to it that elevates the sometimes silly material kevin bacon and his hair is pretty good as her husband but mcgovern steals the movie with her quiet true moments of honesty the 'teen film fun that worked so well in other hughes films falls flat here- like a favorite uncle whose jokes made you laugh when you were 9 but keeps telling them when you are 15 and you wish he 'd find some new material but i keep going back to mcgoverns performance because it 's truly moving mr. hughes most interesting films to me have real actors in them some kind of wonderful breakfast club and when his material bumps up against a true talent some wonderful things can happen if only he 'd trust that it does n't have to be tarted up with the silly fantasy stuff,0
"5 years ago if you were to watch an australian film you would expect to see crocodile hunters stories of war drag queens kangaroos and koalas and australians in general being represented as nitwits living off the land saying words like cobber and generally being the classic underdog luckily australian film has evolved over the last couple years and is churning out modern day classics such as blackrock moulin rouge chopper yolngu boy and sample people in this evolution of film we also find two hands set in sydney 's kings cross two hands is a black comedy about crime and survival in the rough end of town pando played by bryan brown is a sydney mob boss he 's the king of organised crime wearing thongs carrying a stubby and helping his son with his origami he 's vicious but real as are his mob holding gun 's to someone 's head in one scene and then playing boardgames in the next they are well respected and if they ask you for a favour you do n't say no enter jimmy played by heath ledger jimmy is your average aussie guy in his early twenties he 's a good guy who wants to make a name for himself without getting on anyone 's bad side so when pando asks jimmy to deliver 10,000 jimmy accepts things start to get exciting when 2 teenagers manage to steal the money while jimmy is at the beach so now jimmy is 10,000 in dept to a major mob boss from here we start to see all the interconnecting stories with jimmy and his attempt at a bank robbery to recover the money jimmy and alex the love interest played by rose byrne pando trying to find jimmy and of course the two teenagers and their new found prosperity the concept is deepened by the narrator jimmy 's dead brother michael who was killed by pando and his gang years earlier in the end all the storylines connected really well with a surprise twist to shock and stun the audience i thoroughly enjoyed it",1
the worse film i have every seen like the other honest reviewers it is just an excuse for getting naked birds with their juggs out do n't get wrong naked women is n't a bad thing but there is another film genre for that boyfriends beware i sold this to my girlfriend as a classic bike gang fest due to reviews to be greeted with every other scene full of naked women gyrating about the place slap in the chops for me what makes me laugh the most is all the dogey bike dives they went to in the film were full of models with the works cosmetically what biker bars have these they are usually slightly haggard with tattoos and far saggier juggs completely unrealistic.the acting is terrible loads of pointless swearing and a complete waste of time storyline did anyone check out vinnie jones 's attempt at an american accent its as embarrassing as his football skills avoid like the plague the only reason you would watch this film is if you are a young lad who cant access p rn and have nicked it from their parents movie collection for a few pervy kicks,0
jewel thief is a rare breed of film completely noir in its story but nothing noir about the presentation a young man vinay superbly played by a newly face lifted dev anand at age 40+ is estranged from his police officer dad and finds a job in a jeweler 's store soon random people come up to him and call him amar using just a few pithy moments the presence of a `` doppelganger '' is established then a woman shalini vyjayantimala comes forward and claims to be engaged to said doppelganger she is accompanied by her loving brother ashok kumar who is so convinced that vinay is actually amar he makes him take his shoe off and prove that he is not aamr the 6 toed one the jeweler 's super cute daughter anju tanuja is completely enamored with vinay amidst all this confusion there is a jewel thief on the loose and he is stealing at will slowly we learn from vinay 's encounter with a super hot night club singer helen that the thief is amar the doppelganger many many good looking women anju mahendru faryal are after the hero the police force including vinay 's dad are completely befuddled vinay is slowly falling for shalini/shalu and her brother seems to bless the union the action moves to sikkim as that is where amar 's next heist is to occur the rest is for you to watch the duplicate the girls the men who hang on to vinay 's every word thinking he is their boss amar the loving brother sister duo nothing seems quite right and it takes the deft story telling and direction by vijay anand to conclude this tale in a highly entertaining manner the movie has numerous moments that you will wonder at until they deliciously weave into a grand finale at a dance in a palace in sikkim i was not a big vyjayanthi fan but she is quite competent here although at her chubbiest she is able to add to the confusion in the story in a subtle way but is best when she is sorrowful or dancing tanuja is cute as a button and i loved her in this film i so badly wanted her to get the man dev was well dev if he were not walking like a man with a congenital shoulder defect one shoulder always lower than the other i would wonder who they had found to imitate him yet his style charm and charisma were unfailing in the song yeh dil na hota bechara only dev could look cool carrying a fishing rod to which a large plastic fish was attached ashok kumar was simply awesome dada moni did not miss a beat the entire movie and turned this into one for the history books sd burman spun magic with numbers like baithe hain kya uske paas helen in a blood red rooster imitation dancing on a bar top aasman ke neeche rula ke gaya sapna mera and my personal favorite seductive number raat akeli hai bujh gaye diye if you are craving a great story with more twists than a pretzel wanting to be kept guessing yet amused and entertained then go buy or rent jewel thief better to buy it then you can go back and see it again with your buddies this one is a keeper,1
`` sister helen '' is a superb documentary about a rigid intolerant foul mouthed bitter oblate civilian nun who runs a shelter for drunks and dopers in a very rundown neighborhood in the south bronx all but one of the 21 residents are gutter drunks/addicts robert the only middle class representative  he had a real job house and even a bmw  regrets she died before he could tell her off why robert like six of the residents was on parole he complained that helen wielded a huge stick over him and constantly threatened to turn him in if he did n't cow-tow to her in an `` extras '' interview he said helen ran the center to compensate for the deaths of the three men in her life  her husband and her two boys the husband was an alcoholic who died of a heart attack at 55. one boy died of a heroin overdose and the other was stabbed to death at 15. helen was left with one daughter who she abandoned to run the center the daughter was not pleased she wanted her mom what 's fascinating is how little helen changed outwardly it seems she made a huge sea change but after seeing this riveting and disturbing video a few times -- once with the directors narrating -- it became clear that helen substituted 21 male addicts to boss around to replace her three dead males helen admits she ignored her kids and spent every day in bars but her bossiness intolerance and sharp tongue did n't emerge at age 56. living with her must have been extremely difficult even robert says he stayed clean in spite of helen the film opens with helen abusively demeaning a man who wants to live at the shelter supposedly she is showing off her street savvy another time she publicly demeans mel her `` assistant '' for not bathing for a year then she waves his filthy pillowcase in the air the film is viscous with helen threatening and demeaning people her signature song is `` my way '' her favorite phrase is `` i 'm going to be totally honest with you '' often people who use such phrases turn out o be the opposite the residents are really down and out only robert has any marketable skills beyond pushing a broom they all desperately need a roof over their heads and helen since she runs the place on her own has the power to admit or evict whoever she pleases she has no governing board to answer to and gets no public funding it is her show helen believes in the cookie approach to sobriety she stopped drinking cold turkey and that means everyone else can too she blames substance abuse on the drug or booze and not the underlying issues that drove the men to drink and drug she 's no therapist just a landlady who dyes her hair wears a habit and wields complete power over her tenants and stopped drinking helen also lords it over her inmates by demanding urine ureen she calls it tests on requests twice major a very solid and respected long term older resident -- who she trusted -- failed his tests helen was furious and evicted him major stood his ground and said the results were wrong because he never did heroin helen did n't yield and failed to consider a mistake could have been made this was especially troubling since she knew major for a long time yet she discounted her relationship with him assumed he was a liar and relied completely on the results major eventually discovered the codeine in his cough syrup showed up as an opiate helen never apologized publicly but supposedly made up with major privately helen also had a very tainted reputation in her old neighborhood she tacitly admitted to robert she once stayed up very late one night to slash someone 's tires the person wronged her and certainly deserved to have his/her tires slashed she was not a nice woman so eventually she decided the only way to keep the travis name her last name alive  since the three male travises died  was to start the travis center for some of the residents it was a great deal they complied with helen and in exchange received a cheap safe sober and structured place to live one however said he preferred jail addicts and drunks do n't all need to be treated like children helen employed `` old school '' techniques which have been discredited however no one was forced to remain at the center and for some it was definitely a positive experience the travis center is not a treatment center it is a residence for alcoholics and dopers who what to straighten out their lives to receive the full sister helen experience see all the extra interviews plus the audio version in which the two directors share their experiences living with sister helen and her guests,1
leos carax has made 3 great movies boys meet girls mauvais sang les amants du pont neuf in fact those films were not that great but it has the violence of youth the beauty of juvenile wilderness carax in these three movies was well aware of what cinema was but he tried to make his own vision of the art without thinking about about all he have seen but using it and melting it into his times pola x is a very different movie because carax made les amants du pont neuf a monstruosity of 20 millions dollars a film that has destroyed everything on its way after such a movie you ca n't do another one in the same point of view so leos carax has to changed and he did the movie is n't as beautiful as its first it 's more reasonable no more studio no more dreamed paris carax has entered at last reality it 's not clean anymore it 's not poetic characters carax have become a romantic in the german sense of it,1
i fully agree with the previous reviewer there 's no chemistry between spencer tracy and hedy lamarr and the focus of the film is on their relationship hedy lamarr is n't at her best and spencer tracy appears to be naive simple and overly-hopeful -- both in love and life an idealist role that played out best in 'boys town if you can make it through the ridiculous crowd scene by the train station ... whoa ... it 's rather slapstick and not worthy of any actor in the cast not the best acting on anybody 's part miscast and mismatched story is empty and various and disenfranchised input is apparent hedy lamarr is her absolutely stunning herself which is truly the best part of the film spencer tracy ca n't match the sophistication of her beauty and wardrobe and the film does n't come off as believable for at least that reason,0
this film should have been much better than it was christopher eccleston is an excellent actor but even he could n't rescue this tale of a young woman searching for the truth over her sister 's death spoiler warning in effect the truth is that the older sister played by diaz is just a spoilt selfish and shallow girl who took too many drugs not much of a twist and not that interesting either the film is also overladen with far too many flashbacks and voice overs and lacks dramatic pacing all in all this is definitely worth missing not to be recommended,0
the emperor and the assassin w/english subtitles at 161 minutes is long but the time is packed with a story that barely fits into it golden hued palace scenes and dusty yellow panoramas of chinese landscapes background a true story of china 's unifying king circa 300 bce an intricate plot with a myriad twists and turns is played out with excellent portrayals by the cast king qin 's simple wish for a unified empire for his common people is fulfilled but not without treachery plots and counter plots and oh yes bodies lots of bodies this epic story of china 's beginnings is a great way for westerners to glimpse little known asian history emperor qin 's legacies include the thousands of life-size terra-cotta figures which are still being excavated today as an historical person this film makes it clear that emperor qin should be regarded along with george washington napoleon bonaparte alexander the great genghis khan and julius caesar to name a few of the world 's greatest conquerors/statesmen i highly recommend seeing the emperor and the assassin especially on the big screen,1
great story great music a heartwarming love story that 's beautiful to watch and delightful to listen to too bad there is no soundtrack cd,1
one of the biggest french success of the year 2002 `` l'auberge espagnole '' was also very well greeted abroad which is quite extraordinary for a french film it is not difficult to define the reasons of this success this movie made by one of the most interesting french film-makers of these last years cédric klapisch presents students coming from all over europe and gathered all together under the same roof in barcelona these students are described like the ones you imagine or you see in everyday life either untidy either serious or with a sense of humor i guess that if the movie worked so well it is because a lot of students must have recognized themselves in the main characters portraits and especially xavier 's we follow the movie and so his experience abroad as an erasmus student through his eyes xavier is really an ordinary student with his qualities his faults an intelligent making with quite a lot of ingenious ideas perfectly expresses his lost mind and his anxiety about the world and being an erasmus student on that subject the best examples can be found in two sequences the first one is when xavier asks a woman at university for the papers he has to send to prepare his dea when the same woman informs him about the different necessary procedures all the papers appear on the screen when she is naming them in the next sequence xavier 's voice-over confides to the spectator his vision of the modern world now where to find the second example well the scene where xavier has a thorough medical examination during which klapisch films his visions is widely sufficient to speak of itself moreover the director was n't really interested by his main character 's studies he left this point low-key he rather put a lot of effort into xavier 's private life of course in his love affair with anne sophie but also and especially in his relations with his fellow tenants it is a real friendship story that klapisch shows us with its moments of happiness but also its arguments and its tensions through xavier 's adventure and at the end of his stay he will have been initiated into life which will make him more mature the message that the author wanted to transmit is n't difficult to guess you naively believe that you live in an untidy and complicated world you must n't give up but intensively search to get what you want even if it is difficult apart from this we could also fear that with the topic cédric klapisch would n't avoid a trap the clichés let 's be frank about it they are included in the screenplay but the director does his best not to spread them too much in his movie then the screenplay contains convenient and predictable moments at the airport and before boarding we see xavier shedding a tear after he left his family but fortunately the shortcomings of the script stop here quite funny dialogs and cool young actors perfectly at ease in their roles make up the whole in spite of its weaknesses `` l'auberge espagnole '' is to be taken for a success in the movie of young people besides the whole atmosphere it brings out lets us think that this movie is directed primarily to a young audience ultimately the end of the movie and its big success let us suggest that klapisch succumbed to a fashion that goes right for american cinema the elaboration of sequels and indeed the film-maker currently works on a sequel entitled `` les poupées russes '' let 's hope that it will be as good as `` l'auberge espagnole '',1
another masterpiece that needs a dvd release but some libraries have the vhs and well worth seeking out just a brilliant play about many things foremost being euthanasia `` respectability '' religion and fundamental human relationships the script effectively uses intelligent humor not only to cope with an issue like a severely disabled child but to bind the parents in their love for `` jo '' and each other as the couple alan bates and janet suzman are perfectly matched both in acting virtuosity and in bringing their deep intelligent characters to life i 've recently seen bates brilliant performance in `` butley '' which was released as a film a couple years after `` joe egg '' and he plays a teacher in both cynical intellectual and funny although butley is much darker than his character of bry here if you throw in such great performances in `` the go-between '' `` women in love '' `` whistle down the wind '' `` the caretaker '' and `` georgy girl '' not to mention the more obvious `` king of hearts '' and `` zorba the greek '' and i 'd say that alan bates had a career comparable to peter o'toole albert finney and the other great british actors of his era director peter medak also had one of my all-time favorites `` the ruling class '' released the same year 1972 as `` joe egg '' which comprises a career year in anybody 's book he 's had kind of a spotty filmography `` the krays '' was another highlight but these two gems will mark him as a great director,1
golden boy is in my opinion one the sleeper / lost treasures animes out there a sexy comedy about a young man quest to find his nitch in life and he blunders into all sort of odd jobs that somehow has this rather sexy girl who ultimately falls for him but he not really realizing it its truly something that you can easily miss if you at the name but once viewing it ... will fall for the comedy/silliness that lies inside truly a crime that only produced 6 ova episodes and pilot movie were made however being unique as it is i 'm surprised it survived to produce that many if you want a good laugh with high quality anime that is 100 cgi free check this anime out boy who one day may save the world .... or maybe not,1
when i first watched this film i thought that it would be rally good because it featured my favourite actor of all time he gives a sterling performance though it is fairly obvious he did n't have to life more than half a finger to make the róle work he is the only good thing in it unlesss you 're into explosions and american dream-working class hero trash which i 'm not i do n't get it how can this film get away with being so naf that bit with the little boy being rescued i mean come on you ca n't tell me that he would have been rescued without the fire-guy wearing any goggles i know for a fact that it would have been pitch black in there and you ca n't see for more than a couple of feet infront of you and no breathing equipment he 'd have choked after 2 minutes this film was just bad ok why robert whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy sorry if this is your favourite film,0
it 's not easy to find judas kiss on vhs it 's not available on dvd but i wanted to add this rather obscure movie to my alan rickman movie collection i ca n't understand how the talented mr. rickman gets into these mediocre films judas kiss boasts several wonderful actors an interesting plot and intriguing twists but its strange visual wanderings and chopping editing ruined what might have been a great crime drama many scenes seem to be missing vital information to explain the character 's actions why was our hero immediately suspicious of his bosses why did he mistrust the detective he replaced there were times when i honestly could n't tell if the director meant judas kiss to be a legitimate crime drama or a campy spoof why else would he toss in a topless/alien/lesbian porno scene in the first two minutes that little surprise certainly made me scramble for the remote since my kids were playing nearby did he purposely instruct his two distinguished english actors alan rickman and emma thompson to use such awful new orlean 's accents as an alan freak i confess that i still thought mr. rickman was sexy in a rumpled weary `` take-him-home-and-tuck-him-in '' sort of way judas kiss is n't a great movie but it does have some intriguing moments but i do n't recommend it unless you 're trying to immerse yourself in alan rickman,0
i was looking at the external reviews ebert etc for this film and they were all pretty much negative however after reading many of them i noticed that they all made the same point critics were upset that the film centers around what appears to be a senseless murder of an autistic child certainly this is a disturbing image critics like ebert want a traditional detective story that uncovers why the killing happened and squarely places blame on the guilty they want blame to be cast and resolved well that status-quo theme is kind of what the movie is parodying just like society the critics wanted a very quick resolution so they could move on to their next tragic opera perhaps there is no simple question to be answered here there is a whole lot more to what happened then what is on the surface the film does not seek to rationalize what happens but rather understand the why what also steams me so much about these inane reviews is that all they look at in the way of performances is spacey and cheadle who were both great and generally are but there are other great performances at work here other than just the two current icons of hollywood gosling gives an incredible performance that really only somebody of his extreme talent could deliver somehow gosling is able to make the killer of an autistic child sympathetic this irritates many i am sure however if one watches the film they see what leeland 's motivation is it is wrong but it is not evil malone is also on top of her game as yet another confused young character basically the killing of the child in this film is not the main theme of the movie the main theme is life itself and how people go about dealing with it the highs and lows and how they attempt to sometimes help others deal with their lives which does not seem to work out very well there is a lot of good and bad in this world and how we handle each has direct impact on how much more good and bad will take place and sometimes a confused attempt at doing good can lead to a whole bunch more of bad i think this is one of the more memorable films in sometime and has an ending that is as touching as anything in recent movie history i strongly believe people should view this film with an open mind,1
i was a teenager when this first appeared in theaters and i saw it in japan the film 's plot was n't my cup of tea as a high school sophomore but i went to see it for the 3-d process it had been ballyhooed in the press so that even service personnel overseas had heard of it though it never screened at the post theater the film started the trend of throwing objects at the audience which was taken to absurd levels with later 3-d films i do n't know whether this qualifies as a spoiler but you 've been warned if it is in many films of the time actors would often work in front of a `` rear projection screen '' where backgrounds could be projected to make it appear that they were in a different environment such as a jungle background when the actors were actually on a sound stage this works well on regular films but when seen in 3-d they look like a flat scene behind the actors there were several scenes in the film where rear projection was used and it did n't work well in the theaters if seen in 3-d it will constitute another disappointment the film 's only importance is historical since it was the first of its kind,0
i was part of the cast of space odyssey playing fido in mission control i just want to say that none of us actors specially those in mission control who had to react to a green screen most of the time had any idea how amazing it would turn out to be i knew it was going to be good if only for the sheer camaraderie and professionalism that the production team at impossible pictures provided for everyone involved but when we all saw it for the first time at the screening at the curzon mayfair well i for one felt very proud i was so glad that none of us looked like we were in star trek joe aherne the screenwriter and director is the most amazing man to work for he pretty much gets a good team together and then just trusts them implicitly to freely do what they do best i 'm really lucky to have been part of this show who knew something this epic and complicated to understand would turn out to be so enticing to watch and my god it 's a beautiful universe out there,1
oh god why is it that nickelodeon has such a hard time producing even a half-decent movie i mean this movie might have been good but it was a. too short b. rather superficial stereotypical and insulting to some c. ultimately pointless first of all the `` dress up the nerd to look cool '' thing was very consumerist very superficial very pointless and very insulting it has the stereotypical nerds-stupid faces glasses never kissed vacations with his mom etc well maybe the reason that guy has never kissed a girl is because he 's gay does that mean that all gays are nerds and what 's wrong with being friends with your mother the worst part by far was the ending the whole drama of the movie revolved around zoey finding out chase loved her and blah blah blah and then when chase finally decided to tell her a. he did n't tell her in person because right as he was about to the typical distraction came along b. he tried to text message her but her pda fell into a fountain and died before she got the message the end how lame is that i mean why is it that cartoonists just ca n't change anything in the series so many of us would like to see these two get together why ca n't we see it i mean are the producers really that uncreative that they ca n't think up new problems to go with changes in the series so they have to stick with the same plot and outlines and make as many episodes as they can just using those after a while it gets dull and frustrating i wanted to see some actual romance in here darn it okay i 'm done with my rant,0
what is worth mentioning that is omitted in the other reviews i have read here is the subtext of how the law shaped the lives and behaviour of gays in the era portrayed in the film while courtenay 's character is evidently gay he is not the only one the often talked about mr. davenport-scott is the other and the reason that he is never seen the reason alluded to that he has disappeared seems to be that he has been detained by the police for homosexual activity a criminal offense in england at the time we can read under the surface that this recent event has unsettled norman courtenay 's character and we can also see in a passing remark by oxenby the edward fox character the quick renunciation of any connection to such a person when the law is involved the fear of association affects many of the characters and is part of the portrait the film paints of a time and the people who inhabit it the abandonment of courtenay at the end by sir has been anticipated all the way through if this subtext is included it also makes sense of both the otherwise inexplicable omission of his dresser from the list of those he gives thanks to the flamboyance combined with the fear of exposure produces the combination of yearning and fear that courtenay has to 'step into the footlights as he does when he makes the announcement about the imminent air raids a scene that would otherwise be gratuitous but that is both a symbolic and literal depiction of the man 's inner torment so while the drama is of the decline of finney 's sir a great deal of the tragedy of the film and play comes from the 'fatal flaw of courtenay 's gayness and makes this a film about him as the title suggests the art direction pacing and cinematic style of this film seem to come from another time more distant than the eighties and in some ways even than the second world war the implicit portrait of a society still clinging to an older moral order and the sympathy of the character racked and ruined by the cruelties of that order of necessity trapped in the enclosed world of the theatre and the knowledge we have of how much of it all would be swept away after the war makes this film all the more poignant for all its flaws,1
this is one of my favorite `` capra-esque '' comedies this movie is just meant to be enjoyed not deconstructed microscopically analyzed it 's not religious commentary it 's fun it 's fantasy the surprisingly negative comments imho reflect a level of expectation that professional film critics have led us to think must be a part of every movie others have described travolta 's role it 's the reason you 'll watch the movie over and over and the excellent supporting cast including sparky sometimes a cigar is just a cigar sometimes a movie is just fun enjoy,1
this 'schlock-buster should carry a government health warning if you play it in your dvd machine you are in serious risk of opening a rift in the space-time continuum and disappearing without trace into it so bad is this 'movie the fact that this movie was so successful is evidence of the true desperate state of modern hollywood cinema and the continual commissioning of films that appeal to the 'lowest common denominator although i truly dread to think of the 'lowest common denominators that this film actually appeals to i think hollywood were just conducting some kind of proving trials when they made and screened this film i can imagine the executive boardroom meetings at the studio ... `` just how bad a film can we actually get away with making and still make loads of money holy cow i did n't realise we could go that bad woooo hooooo '' the only films worse than this that i can think of and trust me it is close are die another day rip the bond franchise as i knew it and independence day avoid avoid avoid,0
`` san francisco oh you marvelously desolated town thank you god for destroying it and making bricks fall on our collective heads and for pummeling into oblivion tens of thousands of your innocent obedient sheep oh lord who art so merciful in thy heavenly ways ... '' these should have been the lyrics to the title song of this oh-so inspiring and utterly mindless film the movie starts well enough with gable discovering a cinderella with a highly annoying but much-appreciated operatic voice and she soon shoots to stardom one of the many problems with our cinderella is that she is played by jeanette macdonald who if one `` takes the time '' to look through all that make-up and 30s glitz facade realizes that she is kind of ugly too ugly to be playing this role anyway yet gable and everyone else fawn all over here as if she were some damn beauty or something another problem with cinderella is that her character is so utterly humble wholesome innocent god-loving kind and generous enough to make you vomit for a full hour macdonald plays her admittedly one-dimensional role with the sort of `` ahhh '' `` oh '' and `` ooh '' that serves to annoy rather than make her sympathetic tracy has been better and had better roles than playing this clichéd heart-of-gold god-loving non-child-molesting priest who boxes in his `` free time '' as if priests have anything to do how cute even the ever-reliable gable is not up to his usual standard he is far too animated and his character is far too selfless for someone who is supposed to be an ambitious western `` scoundrel '' though this obviously is the script 's fault the plot is basically this gable and his rival holt play ping-pong with cinderella using her as the ball how well first she is working singing for gable then she works for the square holt then she goes back to gable only to return very soon to holt and of course both want to have her as girlfriend/wife and if the earthquake had n't interrupted this table-tennis plot it 's a safe bet that she would have been bouncing back-and-forth another ten times the wishy-washy little princess that she is there are many far too many in fact musical numbers it 's almost as though they tried to make the first `` disaster-movie musical '' ever how silly the stuff she sings in gable 's `` joint '' is okay but when she starts belting out those high-pitched annoying whines during the opera segments that is when i felt that my ears were unprovokingly and unjustly attacked by enemy sound-fire in fact there is an opera number that lasts 6 damn minutes 6 may seem like little for those who have n't had first-hand vietoperanam experience with such horrors of audio torture but it 's like with dog years a dog 's year is equivalent to seven human ones a minute of opera is equivalent to 100 minutes of chinese torture or a dog urinating acid on your leg i thought this was a disaster movie but it 's more like a near-disaster movie i read that some of the dialog in this film was written by a silent-era film director jesus ... the melodramatic and only occasionally amusing proceedings get interrupted by the real star of this movie namely the earthquake only after well over one-and-a-half hours when joe the earthquake finally does shake up the city and our clichéd characters in it i almost felt like saying `` thank god death and destruction are finally here '' unfortunately joe comes too late into the movie to save it from its increasing mediocrity the scenes of devastation are very good but even the earthquake part of the movie gets ruined pun by a highly annoying religious ending you see gable who professes to be an atheist all along without actually using the word itself finally finds macdonald alive after having searched for days and suddenly he is converted into a believer because cinderella is alive how stupid all that tells me is that gable 's character is a weak-minded moron the movie ends on a very dumb note indeed gable having said `` thank you '' to god for `` saving '' his girl and he does his on his knees `` finds '' god sees the light and the movie 's little old devil gable converts himself into a believer how very god-fearingly american an ending ... of course no one thought of asking this `` god '' why the hell there was an earthquake in the first place the sad and unintentional irony is that gable in the end becomes a `` sucker '' all along he had made fun of `` suckers '' who fall for the holiest scam of them all namely religion and in the end he himself becomes one now that 's what i call a triumph of the human spirit another irony is that the ending was supposed to have improved gable as a person but i see it quite differently on the contrary it took only one big joe to turn gable into a god-fearing meek little obedient believer who joins the world 's sheep family and as if this intellectual downfall of gable 's was n't pathetic and disappointing enough this first-ever `` earthquake musical '' ends with a truly hair-raising take this word as you will noble and hope-inspiringly beautiful mass-choir scene dozens or hundreds of earthquake survivors and proud proud citizens of frisco spontaneously or did `` god '' perhaps arrange it sing all together the title song in hope for a better brighter joe-less future hallelujah if you are a `` sucker '' for hollywood sentimentality do not skip this movie,0
imagine the most depressing winter you will never experience grey instead of white no snow fights and certainly no wonderlands this is the finland as portrayed by 'frozen land this film follows a bunch of people whose lives are oddly linked to each others with results beyond anyone 's nightmares yes most characters are flawed in the way that only celluloid characters can completely annoying and frustrating to watch yet for some reason you wish for their luck to turn with some randomly placed humour and a cast that groups together finland 's somewhat mainstream faces frozen land offers a glimpse of the finnish mentality that despite its depressing downward spirals manages to restore some faith in humanity more so than kaurismäki to say the least,1
i do n't understand why critics would bash this movie it 's a teen movie that 's actually serious which is a rarity i 'll admit that there are moments that are hugely sappy but c'mon it 's about young love it 's got ta be sappy to be valid my biggest complaint is chris klein while he was funny in american pie he apparently is n't ready for the switch into more dramatic fare yet he 's very uncomfortable looking in some of his `` mama stuff '' hartnett and sobieski on the other hand demonstrate a remarkable amount of depth and believability as do the parent 's although the script is heavily cliched with the lovers spouting off poetry the actor 's make it work the directing sports some powerful images on the screen beautiful cinematography nice music great young actors i was impressed and i 'm a jaded critic when it comes to teen movies,1
this movie must have looked when it was being pitched at development stage and getting a redgrave and a jacobi on board must have excited the money men all i can say is that they clearly did not have anything on that week jacobi camps it up in the way that only jacobi can do and i thought that he seemed to more of the actor that he parodied in his cameo role in frasier a few years back vinnie jones is not exactly bad he is just clearly out of his depth as a leading man he is really quite amiable throughout and if this was a pilot for a tv series it may have just got picked up however the scipt and the camera work were appalling quite why this `` jounalist '' and a press officer from the met would ever work together is never explained it certainly can not have been because of the sexual chemistry of which there is none there is nothing wrong with a ridiculous and far fetched plot that you can pass off as original but the whole thing is just so contrived that the two stories just do not make sense at all it was like two stories confusingly edited in to one just to make up two hours go watch some paint dry for a couple of hours you life will be more fulfilled than watching this rubbish,0
got to confess right up front that i did n't watch this entire movie i missed the first hour during a sci fi channel broadcast or was i spared the first hour the other reviewers sum this one up nicely it was badly conceived badly scripted badly acted but the worst thing for me was the adr the entire film which appeared to have been dubbed sounded like it was done in somebody 's garage there was a voluminous echo to the words which just served to make the bad dialog hang and hang and hang even a made for tv movie should have recognized this and the idea that alternate dimensions are differentiated by color saturation went out in the 80s folks,0
having seen carlo lizzani 's documentary on luchino visconti i was bound to higher expectations before watching this film made three years later by adam low but the viewer like me did get dissatisfied ... i faced a need for critical opinion which i generally do n't like giving due to the fact there are no documentaries that will satisfy every viewer there are also no documentaries that will examine a theme totally but when i read the reviews already written on this title i also felt a bit confused people sometimes do n't know what to criticize therefore to be clear i 'll divide this film into two major parts that differ considerably the former one about visconti before his director 's career and latter one about visconti the director the aristocratic background all the hobbies the wealth that young luchino experienced and enjoyed are clearly presented his effort in horse racing is mentioned as well as his relation with his mother so much disturbed after his parents divorce we also get a very accurate idea of where luchino was brought up as a real count of milano in riches galore with nannies cooks with access to everything in true aristocracy for instance his father 's splendid villa at grazzano and other marvelous villas prove that there is also an emphasis on visconti 's crucial visit in paris in the 1930s where he met eminent people `` left wingers '' who later had impact on his style and message in art that clearly explains the idea of a communist with the aristocratic upbringing a contrast at first sight however the part about his director 's career which started with ossessione during wwii and ended with innocente just before the director 's death in 1976 is poorly executed his movies are not discussed well why because there are very few people who really have something to say franco zeffirelli the director remembers the works on la terra trema and that is all right there are also some interviews with franco rosi but later such movies like il gattopardo la caduta dei rei la morte a venezia or ludwig are mostly discussed by helmut berger although i liked the actor in the role of ludwig i did not like the interviews of his moreover some thoughts he reveals are not accurate to entail in such a documentary ... there is no mention of significant works of visconti like conversation piece there are no interviews with eminent cast burt lancaster a mention about silvana mangano and romy schneider should also be made there is one footage interview with maria callas that appears to be interesting but that is only a short bit franco zeffirelli though i appreciate him as a director makes fun of it all rather than says something really precious for instance he mentions the event how visconti separated from him after years of service therefore i say simplified and unsatisfactory what i find a strong point here are footage interviews with visconti himself as a result we may get his own opinion about his works for instance i very much appreciate the words he says about death regarding it as a normal chapter of life and as natural as birth itself he also discusses his health problems after the stroke while filming ludwig i believe it is better to see luchino visconti 1999 by carlo lizzani than this doc although it is shorter and condensed as a whole you will get a better idea of the director visconti would be furious about that and the fury of his usually turned people 's emotions and viewpoints into stone ... 4/10,0
shrieker is a full moon production i knew what to expect very little quality but i did n't expect this to be as painful as shrieker was to watch it 's just awful bad acting confusing script and direction annoying characters i wanted to kill the whole thing was probably made in one week i 've seen episodes of charmed that were more complex and convincing than this cheapie it has the look and feel of an orphaned episode of a badly conceived tv series no one has ever seen it was a chore to watch and i could feel my mind getting dimmer and dimmer by the minute watching a movie should n't be this much hard work,0
hey what a great idea to open a film show someone s home movie drama schools must be full of idiots there they are taking drama lessons hoping to become the next big thing in hollywood when all you have to do is send a home movie to a studio hey i think i ll send in the video of my wedding and call it the greatest romance ever seen or send in a tape of my honeymoon and call it the greatest sex ever seen oh hold on i m not married and i ve never been on honeymoon not to worry i ll send in a video of someone elses wedding/honeymoon mild spoilers you d think with an opening like that shark hunter could only improve wouldn t you as shocking as it may seem the home movie is the best directed best written and best acted part of the film alas it s all downhill from here as the family go to sea in reality a fog shrouded swimming pool in a three foot yacht where mom and dad get eaten by a cgi fin and their son spencer swears revenge against the fin cut forward to the present day and the french are using an underwater research base for oil exploration only thing is and it s so obvious you can t fail to notice this it s not filmed underwater the director hasn t made any attempt whatsoever to even use the unconvincing technique of shooting the scene through a fish tank the underwater research base is blown up by the shark maybe it s hired by greenpeace killing everyone inside and spencer now a grown man is hired to hunt down the shark that killed his parents and a bunch of frenchmen what else happens no idea because i decided to watch something else no hard feelings if any of the cast and crew are reading this and i do hope matt codd becomes a big fish in hollywood you think you know about sharks matt you ain t seen nothing yet,0
i am profoundly grateful to have seen this movie the acting is astonishing the movie itself is powerful and clear and the issues involved are handled with subtlety and depth this is an important movie it could be profoundly transformative i would pay good money never ever to see it again because it is so good and so complex it is extremely difficult to watch i admit that my taste in movies tends strongly toward light entertainment the visual medium can be so powerful that i tend to avoid it for anything really important those of you with greater fortitude than i have may find it easier to handle but i strongly encourage people to see it at least once preferably with others so you can talk to each other and have someone around to remind you that there 's more to the world than the movie,1
i ca n't believe i actually spent almost three hours of my life watching this this must be one of the most unbelievable predictable and cheesy television movies i have seen in a long time i was hoping for some good special effects and action instead i spent the entire time rolling my eyes and yelling `` oh come on `` at the screen the dialog is shallow and obvious the acting strained at times and as the story moves along is n't it just funny how everything happens at the same time ... not to mention the obvious and nauseating ending ... now i 've seen more than my share of disaster movies i am a big fan actually and think that often they can pull off completely unrealistic stuff as long as it 's done in a fun way but this is definitely not it this is just an insult to intelligent viewers everywhere what were they thinking when they made this movie,0
this is a film by oshima the director of the notorious `` in the realm of the senses '' a film so sexually brazed and unabashedly controversial it was banned for a while this film takes place initially in 1895 in japan and stars the very pretty keziko yoshiyuki as seki the wife of a rickshaw driver who falls for a much younger man who woos her in kind that man toyoji comes to her as she was sleeping and seduces her though she soon is rather willing to be seduced soon they are having an affair and plot to kill seki 's husband to be together forever they do and throw him down a well however they did n't count on the ghost of the dead husband haunting seki and others in the village this film is visually very stunning the use of shadows highlighting this tale of murder for passion ms. yoshiyuki who is still active as an actress is especially very good in her role its sexual at times but not like `` in the realm of the senses '' some of what ensues is up to our imagination i found this film to have a consistency of mood that makes it very watchable a little creepy but that goes with the territory i 'd recommend this,1
before hitting international acclaim with the silence of the lambs director jonathan demme cut his teeth making quirky comedies this was one of them and like quite a few oscar winning american comedies i could mention it has a fine concept is well paced has great performances a complicated romance but it just simply is n't very funny pfeiffer is mob widow who moves to the city backwaters after her husband baldwin is murdered the crime boss who killed him stockwell takes a fancy to pfeiffer his wife reuhl is furious and to complicate matters pfeiffer also falls for the cop who is trailing her all of this should have been a laugh a minute pfeiffer sporting a hefty wig is excellent as the widow as is the hyperactive ruehl and modine is good too as the nice cop but the script is simply devoid of one-liners wit humour or punch lines of the verbal or physical kind that this kind of film demands the result is it raises smiles at best rather than guffaws it oozes charm but is tediously short on humour,0
the movie `` inhabited '' is about a family of four moving into a new house not knowing that dangers are lurking.the daughter befriends the dangerous creatures as they gain her trust when they do they use it against her a man who use to live there as a child or a teen knows about the creatures and try 's to warn them the creatures steel and take shiny objects to make new stuff out of them mostly weapons.they has a cat and it murderously disappeared the man that tried to warn the little sister was tricked by them and end up into a psyciatric ward she then help them defeat the creatures and destroy the man one after they do they leave for good with nothing but each other and something happens to the doctor,1
`` the core '' meets `` crack in the world '' 1965 made for tv the acting is stock the suspense predictable once you subtract all of the plot ripped off from `` the core '' basically the manned drilling machine you end up with the plot of `` crack in the world '' `` crack '' was a truly excellent movie starring dana andrews his team of scientists working in south africa drilled down to the crust and `` punched through '' with a nuclear device in order to provide a steady source of geothermic energy one of his subordinates also a brilliant scientist disagrees he believes that the blast will not drill a simple hole but will instead form cracks in the crust possible spoiler he is right in order to stop the resultant crack from destroying the earth they must place another nuclear device in the path of the crack although i have placed a spoiler warning i do n't know if i really spoiled anything for either movie and since `` crack in the world is only available in very rare vhs format if at all my decision not to reveal whether or not the counter-blast works is probably academic all in all i rate `` descent just below average,0
i would have liked to put 0.5 but unfortunately i ca n't who can write so bad scripts i saw the movie five seconds and knew the `` bad boy '' would be sutherland needed to pay his taxes when you see how good he was in redford 's movie `` ordinary people '' and others though i do n't like it but i had no choice i saw the movie in french but i know that hearing the real voices of sheen sutherland and hamilton would have not change things except maybe making it more pitiful what makes me sick is that people earn their living making this bad stuff i forgot to speak about mr waterson far away from the woody allen 's movies he once used to play in we had another movie on another french channel a silly james bond with brosnan i am not talking about the real bonds with connery please it 's the end of holidays wake up,0
this truly is an australia cult classic if you 're one of the lucky ones to have seen it -- then you are very lucky it has been released in most countries but not in australia for some reason i have a copy on dvd from the uk not a great transfer but i bought it having seen it previously at a film festival the directing is spot on and the performances rock this is dark film scary film but often times very funny in parts i urge you to see this film there is a coolness about this you do n't see in 99 of the typical aussie fare the screenplay is very well crafted and sends you on a journey where you know it will end badly but until the last ten minutes you just ca n't pick how badly great work from the four leads especially lachy hulme when its all said and done great work on display,1
i really wanted to like this film especially after all the buzz i 'd heard revolving around it but sadly it just did n't work for me paranoid park suffers from the same delusion lost in translation did -- if you use very little dialogue be heavy on the slow motion close ups and concentrate on pieces of fabric in the setting then your story will magically come across as deep and thoughtful much of the plot line if you can find a plot of this film is contrived i was n't impressed with the 'write it all down confessional being the way the protagonist deals with the accident -- so what are we supposed to believe he grew up happily ever after and wrote a book about his experiences thus was vindicated for that horrific incident what is i suspect supposed to be a film that evokes empathy for a young man who is directionless and faced with an impossible moral quandary instead creates a portrait of a future sociopathic personality he has no connection to anyone around him and by the end of the film has no real sense of what is right or wrong he has no direction at home and feels nothing for his friends what we have is a portrait of a non-person a spirit that merely coasts through life as he weaves his way along on his skateboard i do n't feel for him at all and honestly i wish he 'd been caught the entire film centres not necessarily on his feelings of guilt but on how he is going to avoid punishment and/or accountability for a bad decision he not only gets away with it he finds a way to subtly rationalise it quite a frightening negative message the suggestion being that so many of our youth are so disconnected from right and twrong that they simply make up the rules as they go along serving themselves for good or ill. i find it an insulting treatsie on today 's youth and the pretentious arrogance of the film-maker drips thick with every plodding overthought step and shifting eye he did murder the guard but if you blink your eyes you miss it whether it was an act of mercy or not is hard to say -- it could be he was so mortified he lashed out with his skateboard when he runs to the security guard 's car one of the wheels of his skateboard is stained with blood,0
this is a very very very bad movie the plot is weak the acting is bad and the science is worse the special effects are unconvincing the dramatic scenes are a joke every step of the way you can see coming a mile away the end is disappointing and there is no suspense the best aspect of the film is the soundtrack the only reason not to give this a lower vote is because it is a tv movie and i believe the budget was low to start of with i do believe that the young female fans of luke parry will still see this movie however he has done better work again this is terrible very very very terrible if you have a choice look at something else,0
the only thing i expected that this film did n't have was an intelligent talking motorcycle this film is just plain awful i gave it 1 star which of course means i enjoyed it tremendously bad acting bad writing bad directing bad fight choreography the only real actor in this movie is martin landau who of course does a good job playing the villain although the character is your standard cardboard cutout evil ceo/villain even the so-called `` plot twist '' at the end was no shock there was so much to make fun of in this movie i enjoyed it a lot and it did have a few impressive car wreck stunts like bad movies check this one out ouch want a good movie not here,0
this short which won an oscar spawned two sequels and a tv cartoon show has minimal animation but adelightful script by theodore geisel aka dr. seuss and aneven more memorable and enchanting main character upa pioneered a style of animation that even influenced disney during the mid-1950s and produced some of the best animated shorts done in the late 1940s and the 1950s this is on of their finest god to have it in print highly recommended,1
several things become apparent after the first few minutes of this film first the scenery and special effects are incredible -- the best and if everything else worked as well its austere presence might have made it a great film but as soon as the actors open their mouths you suddenly realize that you are sitting in your den watching a movie the story itself is full of cleché and melodrama and the dialogue is some of the worst i 've ever seen and as if that were n't bad enough they made a fool out of the protagonist and in my experience you do n't want to do that unless the film is a comedy bottom line i had a hard time getting into it and i would n't recommend it,0
not much to say other than it is simply a masterpiece this film contains a myriad of messages that all should take to heart especially- women do not squelch your man 's dreams -honor them -that 's why you loved him in the first place those who plan for death will live in the grave those who carpe diem will awaken those who live in fear even our lord spoke of this when he chastised the the one who buried his talent in fear that he might make a mistake and displease the master take a risk get out of the boat and you will walk on water life is a journey that does not end in the grave but in our minds and souls,1
only three words are really required for this review piece of crap if you enjoyed watching the cartoon as a child you will find this movie to be a complete waste of your time and money the best thing about your two hours in the auditorium will be your feet sticking to the floor yes they do use all of the names and catch phrases the even name the dog `` shoeshine '' in reference to the dog being `` shoeshine boy '' in the cartoon they name the love interest polly but she is n't miss sweet polly purebred my wife and son drug me to see this they should have drugged me to see it the original underdog was voiced by wally cox the ultimate nerd this one is voiced by someone with a `` smart alleck teenager that knows more than all the adults '' attitude as a stand alone movie it is awful as an homage to underdog it is even worse it is not an homage it is not a retelling of the story it is not an updating of the story it is purely an attempt to cash in on a known title and create merchandising the next time i go to the store i fear that i will see underdog toys pajamas towels sheets clothing etc mcdonalds and burger king probably fought over the kid 's meal rights for this the worst part of this movie however is the soundtrack they do the underdog theme song to rap read that with a silent `` c '' at the beginning great now that we are going to destroy something let 's go all the way i knew that it would probably be bad before i went my fears were confirmed when i arrived at my local 12 plex and found that they opened it for the first day and first showing in their smallest auditorium and one of only four without stadium seating even the theatre people knew it was going to be garbage save your money on the tickets and invest it better by going out and buying the original series on dvd it will be more entertaining and have better production values,0
my caddy limo was destroyed well i had one just like it drove the hoi polloi and many of the chosen ones around manhattan for a few years that was a whole lot more entertaining than this movie i can tell you lordy what a bomb as in rpg go boom i also drove a lot more stars in my white caddy than appeared in this dud of a flick robert patrick is a very serious actor and did a credible job with the nonsense he had to work with unfortunately rutger hauer played his part like a red-nosed circus clown if he could n't take it serious why should his audience the director should have kicked his butt off the set in the first hour of filming the dialog was written by 10 yr old 's for 8 yrs old 's surprised there was n't a whole lot more cracking up on the sets oh well i am a movie fanatic ergo you must take the bad to get to the good,0
this movie is not at all like city of god you might get the same feeling but it is n't there 's no intense shooting nor intense drug scenes you get the idea if you ask me i think this film was a waste of time there are a lot of other films which gives 100 times better meaning and teaching than `` wooden camera '' yes i might be the only one to give a negative comment for this film but it 's only in my opinion it 's one of those films where i can get the feeling that i 'll be blown away but when the credits start to role my friends and i all gave mutual looks and we all laughed at how ridiculous this movie was so to conclude this matter i advise not to watch it personal note making africans talk english was a big mistake in city of god they used their native language which gave the film much more power and reality,0
that 's about the only redeeming quality in a movie that otherwise insults the viewer 's intelligence by losing track of time plot and reason for being produced plus how that guy with the glasses ever got a gig in hollywood is beyond me,0
it 's interesting that someone made a comparison of the `` fifth missile '' to the star trek episode it should be pointed out that the original star trek tv episode in which the crew of the enterprise undergoes a space madness while orbiting planet si 2000 is entitled `` the naked time '' not the `` naked now '' the `` naked now '' refers to the first regular star trek the next generation episode in which the enterprise-d encounters a science vessel this episode though does refer to and is based on the `` naked time '' original series one now to the firth missile while the reactions of the crew in the star trek episodes were based on those similar to alcohol intoxication the crew 's condition on board the montana was caused by a much more serious situation namely the paint vapors emitted by the faulty bulkhead finish there are few places where such a reaction could have more serious consequences than among a crew who has responsibilities as serious as a crew on a ballistic missile submarine and of course this is what makes the film so suspenseful and such a thriller the plot is very believable at the same time this film along with `` crimson tide '' `` the day after '' `` by dawn 's early light '' `` the hunt for red october '' `` ice station zebra '' and many other similar movies give us much insight into how easily things could go wrong and just how easy it could be for a nuclear holocaust to begin thankfully such an event has not occurred and god willing such an event will not happen,1
a couple of men are ship-wrecked on a remote island they are then captured by an insane count who lives there with a small group of servants while in the castle dungeon lives the count 's unfortunate leper wife the dungeon of harrow is pretty much a hack job of a movie the amateur actors all sleepwalk through the film while an annoyingly insistent score continually plays in the background the various bits of action are all filmed in an incredibly unenergetic way in fact the film in general is completely lethargic it just seems to drag on and on and even though the ending is n't too bad you will be hard-pressed to care by that point as an example of 60 's gothic horror this is strictly a bargain basement example i sadly ca n't recommend this one really,0
the biggest tragedy surrounding this thoroughly delightful movie is its lack of u.s. distribution i was fortunate enough to see this film at the boston international festival of women 's cinema and highly recommend it to anyone who gets a chance to see it terrific performances and thoughtful script and great direction from the talented and funny rose troche all combine to make this film a winner,1
i was suckered in by the big names rob lowe mario van peebles burt reynolds and the fact that it was an independent film unbelievably slow beginning 35 minutes two dreary songs and a botched rip off i did n't care about the characters and the plot never tempted me to even pretend it could be realistic i ca n't believe this is what makes it to the screen i loved watching this film because it felt so good when it was over,0
`` catchfire '' or `` backtrack '' as it is sometimes called is not very good that is it 's bad jodie foster had already won an oscar at this point why did she agree to do this i do n't know the hostage/kidnapper relationship is not believable even if it is a common psychological phenomenon in real life worst of all this film features a scene where hopper and foster ride a boat under the fremont bridge a bridge in seattle which means that traffic had to stop so that the bridge could open i 've had to wait for that bridge to go down many times almost all of them on the bus it 's not a pleasant wait this film caused unnecessary bridge-waiting and the world is a worse place for it,0
garden state must rate amongst the most contrived and pretentious films of all time the plot is a simple one involving a young man returning home after his mother 's death and discovering love but really the plot is n't important what is important to zach braff writer director and star  is that he is able to hang from the plot all the necessary accoutrements of an 'indie or 'arty film we therefore are presented with endless cute and quirky characters and scenes that do n't exist for reasons of plot or character development but simply to give some artistic credibility to the film à la wes anderson or so braff hopes unfortunately and somewhat astonishingly braff has not only fooled many on imdb but also some critics who really ought to have known better of course braff 's gratuitous use of the quirky alone does not make garden state a bad film what really makes garden state a stinker is braff 's script he simply does not have the writing skills to carry this film off and the dialogue and characterisation are abysmal braff often has to resort to blunt devises and symbolism to achieve what he ca n't achieve through the writing for example the numbness of the braff character is shown to us by his indifference to an impending plane crash this ca n't be worked into the plot and so has to take place in a dream later he is shown fighting back against his circumstances by screaming into a bottomless abyss life a bottomless abyss very clever mr braff those two scenes must rank amongst the most ludicrous and contrived ever seen on a cinema screen on the plus side the acting is passable despite the lack of material for the cast to work with by which i mean a script and i do admire natalie portman for her efforts as the love interest a character so badly written and implausible that she is little more than a mindless doll that braff moulds into his fantasy woman it apparently took braff 3 years to write the script for garden state 3 years to write a script this bad he really is inept hopefully therefore it will be some time before he makes another film,0
`` buffalo bill hero of the far west '' director mario costa 's unsavory spaghetti western `` the beast '' with klaus kinski could only have been produced in europe hollywood would never dared to have made a western about a sexual predator on the prowl as the protagonist of a movie never mind that kinski is ideally suited to the role of 'crazy johnny he plays an individual entirely without sympathy who is ironically dressed from head to toe in a white suit pants and hat this low-budget oater has nothing appetizing about it the typically breathtaking spanish scenery around almeria is nowhere in evidence instead costa and his director of photography luciano trasatti who shot another kinski western `` and god said to cain '' lensed this horse opera in rather mundane setting around tor caldara lazio italy and monte gelato falls treja river lazio italy nevertheless `` the beast '' qualifies as a continental western because it deals with wholly unscrupulous characters and the action could be classified as film noir because the hero and heroine are trapped by intolerable circumstances that compel them to resort to criminal activities predictably their well-laid plans backfire owing largely to the kinski character indeed the licentious kinski character resembles a wily e. coyote type character consistently he struggles to have sex with several beautiful women but either lawmen or outlaws frustrate each of his efforts ultimately `` the beast '' amounts to a tragic character study brimming with irony the stelvio cipriani orchestral score sounds as if it were lifted by the tony anthony western `` the stranger returns '' the mario costa screenplay takes place on the western frontier between san diego and mexico that is being terrorized by a notorious mexican bandit called machete giovanni pallavicino of `` we still kill the old way '' and his gang they prey on the stagecoach and nobody is safe from their depredations the first time that we see 'crazy johnny laster he pauses to refresh himself at a stream and spots a gorgeous looking woman washing clothes he creeps up behind her and attacks her but a bigger man armed with a rifle intervenes and he has to flee he shows up in a nearby town and a snuff-snorting gunslinger recruits him to help ambush a wealthy man mr. powers on the trail and rob him they wind up killing him and getting no money mr. snuff-sniffer accidentally leaves his snuff box at the scene of the crime and the sheriff arrests on suspicion of murder 'crazy shoots his accomplice from his hotel room so that he does n't have to worry about being implicated in the crime meanwhile a young couple in love are having trouble making their way in the world riccardo steven tedd of `` requiem for a bounty killer '' lives a mexican couple on their ranch and helps them raise their real son juan in the village riccardo 's lovely girlfriend juanita gabriella giorgelli of `` stranger in sacramento '' sings and dances in the cantina riccardo and juanita plan to marry but the last place that juanita wants to settle down is on a dusty ranch she dreams of living in the city but life in the city requires more money than either riccardo or she has they team up with a blond outlaw name glen paolo casella of `` shoot the living and pray for the dead '' and they plan to kidnap mr. power 's daughter nancy when she comes to get her inheritance glen makes the fatal mistake of enlisting 'crazy johnny to help them because glen knows that johnny needs the money to get women they abduct powers daughter and keep her at a remote cabin with johnny standing guard over her meantime juanita masquerades as powers daughter and shows up in town to get the money from powers attorney gary pinkerton giuliano raffaelli of `` blood and black lace '' but he grows suspicious because juanita does n't look anything like he remembered nancy riccardo brandishes his six-gun and warns pinkerton that they have kidnapped nancy unfortunately for riccardo and juanita pinkerton can only lay his hands on 50-thousand because machete has struck such fear into the hearts of everybody that the powers total inheritance can not be shipped through the territory by stagecoach meanwhile back at the cabin horny johnny tries to rape nancy but she outsmarts him knows him out with a chair on the pretense of needing to be alone while she undresses after she knocks him unconscious she steals a buggy and drives it back to town johnny recovers pursues her and murders her about the same time that glen riccardo juanita and pinkerton meet him on the trail they inform johnny about the complications created by machete 's reign of terror and give him 12-thousand as his cut of the money pinkerton is aghast at the sight of nancy 's bloodstained corpse and threatens johnny naturally johnny guns him down in cold blood on the spot things really begin to deteriorate as the law in san diego sets out to capture machete glen riccardo and juanita return to mexico while johnny attacks two women at a ranch and narrowly escapes getting caught he rides to mexico finds a cantina whore and is going down on her when a bounty shoves a revolver in his face johnny confesses that he knows where they can find more money if they will release him machete 's men follow up on johnny 's tip and capture juanita the villagers join riccardo to attack machete and johnny rescues juanita but she dies later on after a big shoot-out riccardo is left standing alone now machete and his men retaliated against his step parents not only killing them but also little juan everything that riccardo and juanita dreamed up having goes up in clouds of gun smoke for an unhappy ending 'crazy johnny dies and never gets to assuage his lust if you think about costa 's uncompromising sagebrusher `` the beast '' emerges as an interesting character study and an exercise in film noir in a western setting where everybody is punished,1
"the battleship potemkin was said to have been a favourite of charlie chaplin it presents a dramatised version of the mutiny that occurred in 1905 when the crew of the russian battleship potemkin rebelled against their officers of the tsarist regime the film is a textbook cinema classic and a masterpiece of creative editing especially in the famous odessa steps sequence in which innocent civilians are mown down in the bloodshed the happenings of a minute are drawn into five by frenzied cross-cutting the film contains 1,300 separate shots and in 1948 and 1958 was judged the best film ever made by a panel of international critics the battleship potemkin is in the public domain in some parts of the world",1
i spent many a sleepless night after watching 2001. not only because of the psychological horror of which 2001 is a masterpiece but also because of the way it brought me a restless soul some clarity to the way i observe the universe it changed my way of thinking in a very profound way and after reading the novel by arthur c. clarke i found myself once again inspired a writer as i am by the level of imagination the space odyssey is not something one can just `` go and see '' one has to be ready for it or it can not be understood in fact i do n't think it can be understood at all at least not all of it at once it is a philosophical journey to the infinite and beyond a masterpiece of it 's genre and still after 32 years technically quite impressive all the way to the powerful musical soundtrack featuring 'also spracht zarathustra by richard strauss and 'blue danube by johann strauss take all the time you want but eventually you are going to have to see this film if it can bring some order and understanding to the universe of a struggling artist like me it can certainly do it for you as well or maybe i 'm just plain crazy ...,1
i could n't relate to this film i 'm surprised that people are lauding it for being so 'realistic how many people at your school were victim to incest how many closet homosexual jocks were there how many quiet people that you never noticed committed suicide hmmm ok you would n't know even if their were but really these are explosive problems which many us never deal with and yet there are so many teenagers with subtle problems which could have been explored but hey where 's the 'entertainment in that with regards to the girl who committed suicide i found this to be exploitative i actually think many people in high school at some stage feel invisible ignored and unwanted but what possesses someone to violently commit suicide on just another day of being ignored and unnoticed the filmmaker decided this girl would suicide to make the film more provocative and the graphic nature of the suicide to make it even more provocative i did n't buy it as a real life scenario and the problems of the other students i did n't fully relate to bullying is explored but that 's been done to death we all know it goes on and it truly is a matter of resolve within that person closet homosexuality pfft another cliché gets rolled out thats the thing really too many clichés i guessed the ending at the start there was a predictable unpredictability if that makes sense you 've got all these characters with explosive problems and one with apparently none and i thought what is the point of this character unless she 's the unsuspecting suicide victim and surely enough .. one thing i will say and it is the saving grace of the film is that it does not glamourise suicide the suicide is very graphic and heart-breaking to watch it is a powerful scene regardless of how contrived it is and one that dismisses suicide as the easy option but the film is really not very imaginative and used stereotypes not bad but certainly not groundbreaking or worthy of a 17-minute standing ovation at cannes,0
things i like steve zahn as gus nails the part copies robert duvalls mannerisms which makes him feel comfortable to gus fans some of the other actors copy their predecessors style in this series as well karl urban looks grim and tough but can crack a joke and smile too which t.l.jones did in original series the gear the guns the clothing all accurate or very close to period accurate i 'll never forgive costner and duvall for having a nylon lariat in their chuckwagon in open range the comanches they are actually riding bareback rather than hiding a modern saddle under a navajo blanket and they are n't painted as politically correct peace loving pastoralists but as a proud warrior people there are some dumb scenes but it beats the heck out of yet another variation on doing something stupid to not win a million dollars reality game shows,1
real-life husband and wife paul bettany and jennifer connelly star in creation which recounts the period of charles darwin 's life prior to the publication of `` on the origin of species '' in 1859 his infamous world changing tome on evolution and natural selection darwin 's research created an enormous rift a schism between the believers of his day and scientists he was said at the time to be going to war against god and even to have `` killed god '' the film revolves around darwin 's life with his wife and four children jennifer connelly is excellent as his extremely devout and loving wife a revealing scene at the beginning when she leads the dinner table in prayer and charles fails to say `` amen '' is foreshadowing of what will follow and of the stark differences between the two she is convinced that he will be eternally damned and bring misfortune to their family by rejecting god darwin is torn between his strong love for his wife her faith and his even stronger reason there are beautiful moments of him observing animals dissecting their behaviors and the sequences that make up their lives explaining phenomenons of selection to his children the first born annie having a very morbid curiosity we see him interacting with england 's first orangutan jenny playing with it as if it were a child deciphering her every look and action annie the eldest child later dies and charles becomes haunted by her death having been closest to her in my opinion this part was too long bizarre and drawn out i did not like the trippy scenes where he seems to be losing his mind and is pursued by the ghost of his daughter shouting and ranting although charles thinks that his wife blames him for her fatal sickness she very poetically says `` the truth is if i knew then what i know now i would marry you tomorrow '' their bond is solid and unbreakable despite tremendous differences of belief when charles finishes his manuscript he hands his wife the final copy telling her she can burn it if she does not agree she stays up reading it nights on end and finally presents him with a package the book ready to be sent to its publisher in the end reason and perhaps love as well triumph as he makes an accomplice out of his staunchest adversary it is fascinating that darwin received a full christian burial at westminster abbey proof that his ground-breaking ideas were seen as controversial of course but were already then recognized as vital knowledge for the advancement of the human race the movie definitely draws heavily on darwin 's family life its joys and its troubles i happened to like this aspect but fabio said it was like watching a documentary on i quote `` hitler 's passion for ping-pong '' this is true in some respects and i ca n't disagree with his desire to have learned more about charles darwin 's theories from this film than we do it remains nevertheless a well executed and flawlessy acted period drama my rating 7 fabio 's 7 total score 14,1
before i start i need to inform you that i love horror films with a passion love them i have seen thousands and rarely does one come along that i do not like i am very forgiving of the horror genre one of the greatest lines in movie history is in the film `` ed wood '' where ed wood johnny depp freaks out and yells at the overly critical producers after they comment on `` plan 9 's '' cheap sets and continuity problems `` you do n't know anything have n't you ever heard of 'suspension of disbelief '' well i try to bring that `` suspension of disbelief '' philosophy with me to every horror film i see and it usually works unfortunately it did n't work for me during the screening of cheerleader massacre strike one the first thing you 'll notice about this `` film '' is that it is shot on video and has that crummy hand-held-home-digital-camera style the camera work and quality are so bad it makes daytime soaps look breathtaking in comparison in fact it makes troma and full moon video releases look good and that 's bad strike two jim wynorski this `` filmmaker '' probably fancies himself a chip off the ol corman but nothing could be further from the truth roger corman shot fast furious and under budget but was able to deliver a tight original film though wynorski delivers a cheap film he cheats his viewers and perhaps other artists as he steals entire pieces of james horner 's `` humanoids from the deep '' and `` battle beyond the stars '' musical scores and inappropriately drops them into cheerleader massacre on the back of the box art and during the beginning credits the music score is falsely attributed to dan savio an extra in wynorski 's `` deathstalker ii '' you will also notice how cheerleader massacre jumps from video to film and back again as wynorski lifts entire scenes from both `` slumber party massacre '' and `` humanoids from the deep '' wynorski utilized this deception fourteen years earlier in his horrible version of `` not of this earth '' strike three you 're out while cheerleader massacre does have some nudity 40-year-olds playing teenagers and the grossest set of fake breasts that i have ever seen in a horror film ugh the murders are relatively bloodless what the heck is that all about the film is titled cheerleader massacre but a handful of off-screen killings in my opinion does not add up to a massacre it does n't even add up to a bad mosquito bite the `` film 's '' story is fair enough unseen killer stalks a vanload of cheerleaders old gals playing teens until the van runs out of gas and the `` girls '' are forced to hold up in secluded two-story mountain home i wo n't ruin the ending for you but this is one of those `` films '' where the person who is obviously the killer is not obviously the killer cheerleader massacre would have been great if it were shot on film directed by joseph zito and had special effects by tom savini instead it is an effect-less shot-on-video travesty by jim wynorski ouch i beg of you please do n't buy or rent this abomination if we keep supporting these clowns the more of this talentless video garbage they 'll produce go out and rent `` the prowler '' `` the last house on dead end street '' `` delirium '' or `` the burning '' instead you 'll be glad you did,0
review is of the original 1950 's version not the restored 1980 's one in a land where the king likes no one and no one likes the king a shepherdess and a chimney sweep from two nearby paintings come to life and run off a portrait of the king who loves the shepherdess kills the real king and takes his place a huge bird the wonderbird of the title acts as a hero of sorts and helps out our two lovers this is a strange strange movie ... no surreal very very very surreal the style of the background is very european while the characters are fliescher meet warner but early arty warner of the non major characters they move in both realistic and cartoon like manners this is an odd movie and it takes a bit to get into it but peter ustinov as the bird is a riot his kids and the puppy are wonderful there are cops in rubber ducks and a bear design that makes you smile and there is deep philosophy in the film about the existence of a world out there ... out beyond a metropolis subterranean city this is a really neat movie there is something just so odd and unique about it that rewards you if you stay with it for the whole ride its not perfect but what the hell this is a movie to search out if your local bargain dvd bin has the capcom version paired with alice in paris buy it it should run you under ten bucks probably around five and the price is absolutely worth it especially when you realize it comes with two full length cartoons two short cartoons and several neat commercials and other fun things,1
if i was only allowed to watch one program in my entire life i would definitely have to pick `` the chaser 's war on everything '' of all the satirical shows that have been on australian television i found `` chaser '' to be the funniest of all it is just so amazing the boys are n't afraid to do anything whether it 's dress up as hitler to get into a polish club or push a massive ball of string around melbourne to try out the tourism ad 's or rock up to the coke factory naked in a bath with 2.40 to buy some water the chaser boys will go there in agreement with the comments above and/or below `` the chaser 's war on everything '' is more popular than their previous program `` cnnnn '' but cnnnn was just as funny some unforgettable moments from that show ... clean up cambodia classic so anyway to stop me from ranting further i strongly advise you to at least give chaser a chance you 'll more than likely find it hilarious,1
for the main criticisms of the movie ... the love story that was n't a love story those were two people distraught coming together trying to find humanity in anyone the same thing happened with soldiers and the russian boy it added a feminine touch but come on look at american movies ... no where close to love story there was no storyline does war have a storyline i think that is a silly criticism the storyline is this they start with 400 men and the movie narrowed down to show the lives of about 10 men and how each did their part and died death is the ultimate end to any story just because there was no happy ending does n't mean it has no storyline there was a horrid truth in this movie i would n't necessarily call it `` anti-war '' it had a political statement of course but the movie was n't all about the politics in fact except for a few occurrences when the captain showed up there was never a stifling air of nazi germany they were far enough out of the reach of the main nazi party the fat cats were n't gon na go into russia maybe not completely accurate and not a hollywood hit but it exhibits a fine knowledge of the common soldier i 'd say exactly of almost any nationality and war and what they must go through it was a losing battle of course the movie is going to be depressing and to the person who said that it was gutsy and silly to even portray germans as victims there are victims on all sides in every war any real soldier will tell you that this movie is a fine balance between movie and documentary a few problems with it when arguing for just one but it instills the best of both worlds watch it as such beware however because it is a hard movie to watch if not graphically emotionally i 'm waiting til they make a movie about iraq it will probably have many of the same themes and will be very controversial i want to see who has the guts to do it first jarhead does n't count,1
bwana devil is reputedly the first major studio full length feature filmed entirely in the 3d process supposedly producer oboler went to africa to shoot a different movie but after hearing the tale of two man-eating lions terrorizing railway builders decided on this one it 's a good story too almost hemmingway-like fear redemption the great white hunter and all it 's the telling of the story that seems to drag almost as though filming in the new process was too weighty for the crew the action scenes are stiff almost too staged but these technical problems appear small in light of the film 's dramatic conclusion,1
caution spoiler at the end of the movie it is announced that the bridge collapsed just a few days after it was captured the impression is that the attack was all for nothing in reality taking the bridge at remagen was the last important victory for the western allies it was the crossing of the rhine that the allies had been trying to achieve for six months because the remagen bridge was taken the war ended in just a few weeks the bridge only need to last for a day after it was captured this was enough time for the americans to send combat engineers and a large protective force to the other side and they could then start building a series of pontoon bridges the taking of the bridge was a complete success and meant the that the end of the war was near and would not last through the summer contrary to the cynical nature of the film the victory was heralded with elation by the troops who did it they knew how vital the battle was this film has little to do with real history it was more a reflection of the cynical nature of the time in which it was produced,0
this was made in that beloved age known as the 80s and shot in my hometown of new york city actually this has become one of my favorite b sci-fi movies oh sure it really stinks to high hell but there 's so much to make fun of laugh and enjoy that it becomes more tolerable after every viewing such as try to find the similarities between this and ... well ok there is nothing similarly bad as this well except castle of fumanchu sock puppets can be dangerous to your health create supense by describing through voice over rather than showing any imagery have leading villainess `` valeria '' played wonderfully by angelika jager deliver some of the most riveting lines ever lots of men and women in post apocalyptic fashion aka leather bikinis loin cloths and dead animal fur do be horrified by the end i 'm off to have a salad toodles,0
awful in a bad/good way ... this movie has officially become the worst `` made for tv movie '' in my book ... except for the camp value it offers i give it a 1 in quality and a 10 for the camp value suggestion watch with friends champagne and plenty of popcorn ... you 'll want to throw some at the screen preferably friends who like chris noth from his 'sex in the city days ... this movie is dreadfully funny this is definitely the lowest point in the careers of all cast members ... honestly i do n't know how they controlled the laughter as the lines were delivered daniel j. travanti is absolutely pathetic everyone participated in the school of over acting and poor joan van ark i believe she was the only one taking this theater of the absurd seriously ... she is credited as a producer though her `` mom '' jeans and bad plastic surgery are scene stealer 's this movie also crosses the oh so delicate line of social incorrectness when they introduce a mentally challenged character into the plot this is an obscure movie showing on lifetime listed as with harmful intent .... has anyone else had the pleasure,0
i 'm not going to go into too much depth but showtime was a pretty funny movie there was n't any slapping-your-knee funny scenes that i can remember but it had it 's moments the cast is pretty good robert de niro is good as usual and eddie murphy pulls off a pretty funny performance rene russo was just fine in the film no complaints there there were two characters in the story that i liked that they did n't explain much at all the first one was trey sellars eddie murphy 's buddy at the gym played by ken campbell i supposed he was just a friend of trey 's but i wanted to know more about him the other character that i liked was mitch preston 's robert de niro 's fellow cop/partner played by nestor serrano i guess he was just another cop working with mitch preston but i wanted to know if he was his partner or what not i think maybe i 'm putting too much thought into a movie i mean after all it 's a comedy ... who cares about the characters i guess i do though i was really pleased to see this was directed by tom dey who also directed shanghai noon ever since i saw that movie i was looking forward to his next work i think he did a pretty good job with this film and i again look forward to his next work all in all it was a good movie but i would n't recommend paying full price for a ticket unless you 're a die-hard robert de niro/eddie murphy/rene russo fan it was worth seeing in the theater but not for full price i 'd recommend seeing it at matinee price also here 's some movie trivia for ya the guy who played the camera man played by judah friedlander is the guy in the music video `` everyday '' by dave matthews band he was also the clerk in `` meet the parents '' also starring robert de niro ... and on top of that he also played derek zoolander 's brother in `` zoolander '' both zoolander and meet the parents star ben stiller just some useless trivia for ya i hope you enjoy the film thanks for reading -chris,1
bad ambient sound lots of shuffling loooong pointless scenes eg guy sees interesting woman in lobby manages to stay there and watch her under the guise of waiting for the building supervisor to get a package says nothing stares creepily more shuffling and other irritating ambient noise wait wait wait guy says nothing woman looks frightened or at least slightly disturbed about it and rightly so manager comes back with package guy goes up to the apartment with the package another example the guy and his host sit around watching bad tv more ambient noise and shuffling wait wait wait wait guy wanders off to bed if you can stand to sit through any more of this movie you get to watch them watch tv again later if you want a story any dialogue entertainment or a well crafted film look elsewhere,0
this show is the worst show ever norris and his family write it produce it direct it etc etc the only reason i ever see it is because my goofy wife likes it how many times can norris fly though the air from plain sight to land a kick on an obviously blind villain no trees no building just whoosh ..... thin air he always solves the case or is the best at whatever skill there is no co star ever gets the glory its all norris its truly apparent that norris is awful stuck on himself and will not allow anyone to one up him in any scene no matter what the content terrible acting terrible script terrible series,0
zombie movies are hot i love 'em ca n't get enough why i would purchase a film of this caliber goes without explanation i just really love zombies surprise this really is n't much of a zombie movie low-budget i can handle being duped just irritates me a group of horror-film clichés hold up in a warehouse/lab/who-knows-what to escape a fire storm outside panic yelling low-light and eventually zombies ensue i kind of feel bad for the film makers as it is obvious that they really thought they were putting together something good a serious scary horror film it is n't far from it it 's a boring mess of wooden acting cheesy fx poor lighting excessive dialogue and over editing things first go awry when it takes a good 10+ minutes for the characters to ever sit down and start to figure out what is going on it gets worse when another 20 minutes go by and they are still sitting around trying to figure out what is going on all of this is littered with non-acting and bad dialogue finally some one gets attached not by a zombie though and hope flickers just a touch before the characters are again lounging around whining the only emotion any one every generates about how much this sucks me too guys me too finally zombies are in the mix but no one watching cares any more i think there was some blood and gore tossed in but i was too busy praying for the credits to roll to notice and when the screen finally did fade to black i felt even more cheated by the pointlessly 'cube inspired ending i will give credit for trying very hard even if it failed miserably that and the punk chick was very hot if totally under used ca n't really recommend this to anyone save for film students looking for 'no-no pointers 4/10,0
another great tom wilkinson performance punctuates `` separate lies '' a 2005 film also starring emily watson linda bassett and rupert everett directed by julian fellowes it 's the story of a married couple james and ann manning where the husband wilkinson believes he and his wife watson are happy together an accident near their house on the night they have a party brings the police around it is a hit and run that killed their maid maggie 's bassett husband james becomes suspicious of a neighbor bill bule everett when he sees some damage on his car he confronts bule who admits he did it and promises to go to the police the next day when james arrives home ann is angry that he is making such a big deal out of it and states that she was driving the car of course james then is n't so eager to rush to the police she suggests that they call bule and tell him their decision `` oh f___ bule '' james says `` well that 's just it '' ann says `` i am f___ing bule '' james devastation is just the beginning in this well-crafted drama without giving the plot away this is a good example of how gender switching changes a story example of what i mean susan smith drives her car into a lake and her children drown she gets life in prison what if the father had done it the chair you 'd be surprised how often the outcome would be different the same is true here if it had been james having the affair and doing the subsequent activities viewers might feel differently about the story if ann were in james place it would be shattering as it is it 's tremendously sad tom wilkinson is heartbreaking as a man blindsided by the woman he adores and emily watson does a beautiful job as ann who once she frees herself from her lies her involvement in the accident and the happy marriage knows what she has to do rupert everett as bule is very effective indolent uppity and ultimately in need everyone here is very civilized in their dealings with one another and no one is all good or all bad there are separate lies james that his marriage is happy ann 's as listed above and there is one uniting lie the accident about which all parties keep quiet it 's enough for ann that maggie knows in the end all must deal with the separate lies that the single lie uncovered brilliant film,1
i liked this movie not because tom selleck was in it but because it was a good story about baseball and it also had a semi-over dramatized view of some of the issues that a baseball player coming to the end of their time in major league sports must face i also greatly enjoyed the cultural differences in american and japanese baseball and the small facts on how the games are played differently overall it is a good movie to watch on cable tv or rent on a cold winter 's night and watch about the `` dog day 's '' of summer and know that spring training is only a few months away a good movie for a baseball fan as well as a good `` date '' movie trust me on that one wink,1

i do n't know how people can watch this the only people who enjoy watching this are those who have no feelings and emotions and enjoy watching people die houses burn down car crashes babies die and cast members being killed off every week its the most absurd thing on television and i still do n't know how it pulls in the ratings its so depressing i can imagine the writers sitting down and saying 'so who shall we kill of next week then or 'whose house shall we torch in a months time its the most depressing absurd and most stupid thing on tv at the moment and i cant understand peoples motives for watching this depressing pile of crap anymore,0
having read so much negative press on this movie over the years i 'd always avoided it but the advent of the cheap public domain dvd encouraged me to finally give it a viewing unfortunately it 's been transferred from a poor copy the modern prequel shot on tinted stock is blurry and the contrast non-existent faces are occasionally difficult to make out having said that the actual story is entertaining and lou comes across as an accomplished actor more so than in many of the boys movies once the movie switches to the 'jack story the film switches to 'colour and i use that term loosely most hues are orange or brown the greens look particularly bad dorothy ford as 'polly the giant 's maid was a big plus for me as i enjoyed her in an early 'andy hardy appearance with so many negative comments put down to the actual quality of the print i 'm still happy to give this movie a 7. it gave me a lot of laughs and that 's more than the greater majority of comedies i 've watched over the decades can manage one to watch if you get the chance,1
this story focuses on the birth defect known as fas or fetal alcohol syndrome a disease diagnosed too often among native americans in spite of the down-beat nature of this drama the great script and the characterizations move the story along very well this is arguably smits best performance,1
i am 13 years old and i am writing this review in my mom 's sign in she will write her own review later this is my all time favorite movie.it was filmed in england in 1944. i watched it so many times when i was little that i wore out the video tape i love this movie and it changed my life the beautiful landscapes the mighty pie-bold thoroughbred horse the plain little irish village with the young girl who wanted to do what no other girl had ever done compete in the grand national steeplechase in london with her most beloved horse the pirate it all made me want to ride horses which i have done now for 7 years and learn everything i could about their breeds so i could also draw and paint them it 's a ground breaking movie about winning against all odds overcoming your fears believing in yourself and reaching difficult goals by working very hard also the horse race scene was one of the best ever made and i have seen many movies with horse races i never get tired of watching this movie everything about it is perfect especially if you are a young girl and passionate about horses,1
i thought that this movie was going to be totally lame based on the advertisements that i saw in theaters when my sister borrowed from a friend i decided to watch it because it was summer and there was nothing else to do .needless to say ten minutes in the movie and i loved it amanda was a great actor in the movie her comedic timing was perfect the guy who played duke was hot plain and simple my favorite scene was definitely when amanda walks by the gardener and a fellow student who is suspicious of her and she is talking to her mom about dresses -- as she is pretending to be a guy i re-watched this part over and over ... to make a long story short the movie i thought was going to be lame -- i now own it,1
i liked this western starring randolph scoot and glenn ford.it 's got pretty much everything a western should have.there 's gunfights action chases on horseback.there 's a bit of a romance angle that 's hinted at.there 's some nice comic relief in the form of edgar buchanan who plays uncle willie mcleod a character who pretend to be a doddering old fool but is actually aware of everything going on.randolph scott plays the town sheriff and glenn ford plays cheyenne rogers/bill smith a hunted outlaw who eventually tries to change his ways.i liked the different mix of characters in the movie.i did n't find it always fast paced but i never found it boring either.even though the movie is in 1943 it is in colour 8/10,1
if you described any of the scenes nightmares of children murdering you in your sleep your infant daughter talking to ghosts searching for your lost child in an abandoned mine at night so petrified with fear that you ca n't move even though the blood from a murder victim is dripping onto you from the floor above  then i 'd say you had a horror movie but some how 'wicked little things just was n't scary i am a horror fan and i loved the location the plot in principal and i liked the three leading ladies i did n't want to see them come to harm i wanted the 'bad guy to get his just desserts the rest of the cast are always simply cannon fodder so i was indifferent either way with them and it played out every cliché in the book even down to the torch battery running out in the pitch dark just as you start to here whispering voices closing in on you i would still recommend that you watch it but unless you are new to horror movies or under 12 years you will have seen it all before,0
what a frustrating movie a small southern town is overflowing with possibilities for exploring the complexities of interpersonal relationships and dark underbellies hidden beneath placid surfaces as anyone who has read anything by carson mccullers already knows this does none of that instead the writers settled for cutesy twinkles cheap warm fuzzies and banal melodrama the thing looks like a made-for-tv movie and was directed with no particular distinction but it 's hard to imagine what anyone could have done to make this material interesting the most frustrating aspect though is the fact that there are a lot of extremely competent and appealing actors in this cast all trying gamely to make the best of things and do what they can with this -- well there 's no other word for it -- drivel a tragic waste of talent in particular that of the great stockard channing,0
this is hands down the most annoying and frustrating game i have ever encountered every time you turn around the game takes control of your character or creates invisible walls that you ca n't walk through the cut scenes leave you in control of your character 's movements but only to a slight degree also you have to play the game for about 2 hours just to get past the intro/tutorials it 's terrible i am afraid if i play this game any more i will end up breaking something this game sucks the graphics are good but nothing special the game play however is awful to say i hate this game would be a huge understatement i got it on sale but i want my 20 back what a waste,0
if you like cagney you 'll like this film it has the pretense of american integrity at any cost personal or social cagney plays the head of weights and measures in nyc cagney goes up against crooked politicians the criminal underground a prominent philanthropist and simple grocers who add a few ounces to the price of a chicken the chicken scene is hilarious where cagney finds a weight placed in the bird cavity by an unsuspecting butcher the chicken gets tossed around the shop in a hilarious scene about who controls the `` evidence '' if you like old telephones there are interesting scenes of dials phones and even bizarre phone cords compared to a lot of film made today this is pure entertainment and includes mystery with comedy and a message that honesty above all should be the guiding principle of humanity made in simpler times it reflects a world we ca n't find today the fashion especially hats outwear and automobiles all play a prominent visual role in defining this little film,1
my wife and i enjoy bad science fiction movies some movies are so bad they are good mansquito was one of those that one was bad but it had some redeeming qualities it makes you wonder how a self respecting actor approaches lines like `` hey mansquito '' this one is so bad it has now taken its place as our standard for bad it is n't just a bad movie it really stinks there was the coed strike force the `` indian '' that rode around in a black cloak and used a sword for crying out loud he shot down a helicopter with an arrow we tried to laugh at this movie but there were no points at which it did n't rise above pitiful we could n't come up with any redeeming features except for one those were the words `` the end '' there seemed to be no plot no character development and no point to the movie someone in hollywood needs to be fired,0
i rented the matrix revisited with a friend of mine we both loved the matrix and we both love filmmaking so we wanted to see what was going on behind the scenes of the matrix it turns out that the matrix revisited tells you hardly anything about the art of filmmaking or even how the matrix was made it is basically a huge commercial for the matrix a movie that the target audience of the matrix revisited has already seen if you really want to know about the process and the troubles and the stress and the detail that went into making of the matrix look no further than the bonus features on the original dvd of the matrix there are things they show in those documentaries that i had not even realized had to be done or was done the matrix was such a difficult and challenging film to make that it deserves more credit than a `` documentary '' that 's about as informative and interesting as an mtv special,0
i know what you 're saying `` oh man pinochio is not scary '' but this movie goes beyond alot more than a maniacal pinochio behind it tells the story of a mother and her daughter who is oddly attached to her doll pinnochio who seems to talk to her the only weird thing is that noone else can hear the doll except her in the end is shocking revelation that as did i will shock you watch it give it a try,1
given that dylan thomas is an icon of modern anglophone poetry i expected a movie that would be prone to a hagiography of the subject on the contrary the poet is presented as sexually irresponsible a drunkard a bad father a lier and a hypocrite and perhaps a coward of course one could argue that all those things are an advantage when some one is an artist and especially a poet since one of the purposes of art is to subvert the standards of conventional morality but still i do not thing that a positive role model could crop up from such a bundle of personality traits any way i found the other male hero of the story captain cillic a more endearing character the two female roles were played by actresses knigtley and miller and were truly charming especially the first when she performed songs in slim outfit to inspire bombarded londoners during ww2 another good point is the role that sexual jealousy plays even in relatively progressive milieus that think that age-old conventions can easily be surpassed.the atmosphere of the blitz was also convincing as well as the portrayal of the distinct outlooks among people who have experienced war as opposed to those who talk about it theorizing on it 's possible political outcomes.i think one would recommend such a movie,1
unfortunately this is not one of those movies which at least make you laugh at their unbelievable stupidity it has no entertainment value at all it just plain sucks i do n't know where to start to explain how much this movie annoyed me i think what really takes the cake is the unbearable soundtrack it sounds as if someone took a simple beat and then for the rest of it let a 5 year old child run amok with a synthesizer and taped it it 's really that awful and as if that 's not enough there 's not one scene in the movie without `` music '' =noise by the end of the movie you 're either deaf or already cut off your ears earlier which would at least keep you from falling asleep since there is nothing happening in the movie to keep your attention just a lot of bad acting a few cheap and unconvincing kills no story at all it just jumps from one scene to another and you as the viewer can try to make any sense of it and in the last 30 minutes or so you can witness some of the worst `` special effects '' ever it 's extremely boring do not watch this movie you could do something much more entertaining like staring at a wall or reading the phone-book did i mention how much the soundtrack sucked,0
lou gossett jr. is an excellent and captivating actor but to have him take the role of a `` president '' and then have him act like he 's james bond running around carrying a gun and entering a warehouse to uncover a plot to kill christians and then being able to escape the supposedly high security facility to live another day does not do him justice this movie has so many unresolved issues i will attempt to list just a few 1 what was the purpose of `` stockpiling '' a vaccine if no one is vaccinated for example the preacher could have been vaccinated if the `` tribulation force '' already had vaccine on hand later buck williams wife goes to be with the sick preacher and she herself becomes sick so was the virus therefore contagious if it was contagious then why did ray and his wife go into the church without proper protection why did n't they become sick too and when chloe drank the wine and was `` cured '' how did she suddenly know the wine was the `` antidote '' was it california wine ordinary red table wine could red grape juice been adequate and if the preacher had received `` communion '' at least every time he preached maybe he would have had anti-dote flowing through his body already buck and chloe got a `` heavy '' box of vaccine that was never used what mysterious message should we see in that 2 the presentation of `` evil '' forces who are working with the anti-christ nicolai to destroy the world as being russian chinese etc. is really a relic of the 1950 's and the early james bond era and shows an ignorance of modern society and of humanity are we to believe that russians and chinese are perpetually trying to destroy this planet and for what purpose mere destruction this was such a narrow-minded view of this world and was so cliché as to be laughable 3 the main purpose of this movie was the scene near the very end where kirk cameron and lou gossett jr. are proselytizing the non-believers in the audience by showing kirk proselytizing lou it was a movie with no meaningful storyline too many disconnects with reality and a completely inappropriate plot for a great actor i therefore rank this as a 1 since zero is not available,0
i do not know which one was first released earlier in 1970 cannon for cordoba is an `` europen western '' it was made in spain this means this is fairly inferior to sergio leone 's so-called western spaghetti and to the real american masterpieces of john ford sam peckinpah howard hugues john sturges and anthony mann in my order of merit this order is not to be interpreted as all john ford westerns are better than all by sam peckipahn 's i think imdb 's 100 sort them out all pretty well the worse about this firm is the casting george peppard is fit for a sergeant 's role raff valone for a `` maffia capo '' and giovanna ralli to a `` puttana '' in `` piazza vennezia '' in the sixty 's in rome,0
i saw this film yesterday on tv i had just finished reading the book in which the movie was supposedly based in the opening credits it said `` this is a free adaptation of eça de queirós novel '' i should have turned off my tv at that moment vera sacramento 's idea of `` free adaptation '' is turning a story about church 's influence over people and the hypocrisy of people claiming morality at the end of the 19th century into a story about sex in fact the only thing she adopted from the novel was the sex part which was only mildly referred in eça de queirós novel and of course the name of some characters as of the characters in the novel amélia and joão eduardo were victims of church 's influence amélia was seduced by father amaro and all the time she was controlled by him joão eduardo her fiancé was excommungated by the priests because he dared to criticize them in this movie amélia seduces every one she meets and father amaro is just another victim joão eduardo is a dealer of drugs and illegal weapons vera sacramento has turned a novel which criticized moral costumes of an epoch and turned it into just another movie with lots of bad sex even worse her story was completely empty of ideas two wasted hours eça de queirós surely did not deserve this,0
viewers of independent films know that once or twice a year they are going to see stories about dysfunctional families and they have come to expect them and it 's becoming more of a challenge to keep them fresh but here despite the good cast it just seems more of the same story is about the travis family who is trying to recover from the suicide of matt kip pardue who was a very promising high school swimmer ben jeff daniels is the father who withdraws from everyone and has never treated his other son tim emile hirsch as well as matt but he does communicate of some sort to his mother sandy sigourney weaver who finds his stash of pot and starts to smoke it spoiler alert sandy also starts to flirt with much younger men like the check-out cashier at the grocery store but when she attempts to buy more marijuana she gets busted and hauled off to jail she does n't tell anyone what happened but she does discover bruises on tim 's body and also that ben has taken a leave of absence from work after all this happens sandy falls ill and lands in the hospital where her life is in danger which forces ben to realize that he may have to come to terms with losing another part of his family this film is written and directed by dan harris who has worked with bryan singer on `` x2 '' and also the upcoming superman film and while his script allows these characters to have genuine moments of expressing their pain and confusion the story for me just has too many things thrown in the script touches on so many different areas that you need a scorecard to keep track of them all including drugs sex love infidelity abuse neglect experimentation with homosexuality and a life threatening illness if all those scenarios were n't enough for you harris then tacks on a plot twist at the end that 's supposed to sum up and explain most of everyone 's feelings towards tim while i did roll my eyes at least 2 or 3 times with the way the script kept unrolling one thing after another i must admit that i did n't hate this film and i have to credit the actors for that everyone has at least one good scene somewhere in the film but i wish the story would have concentrated more on weaver and her character than hirsch weaver is exceptional and with a sharper script she could have had a role that maybe would have led to an oscar nomination but instead we get endless scenes of hirsch at parties or his shenanigans with the neighbor next door harris shows he can be a good writer/director but with this effort he just throws so many different things at the audience that the material just becomes labored and contrived,0
the abc gears up it 's repertory company for another unrealistic representation of rural australia yes folks it 's all there baca bourke jeremy sims an actor of little talent fire hero lill libby tanner plays bronwyn craig in the bush fifi nadia townsend town slut preggers by baca 's brother joe i think then there 's uncle geoff the big daddy of lost springs uncle geoff 's scenes are like tennessee williams on speed only saving grace is russian actress natalia novikova as baca 's loony missus she is great i ca n't understand why john waters took the gig as lilly 's psychologist husband must have needed the money i expect still he wo n't last long as lill and baca will be having it off toute suit just watch this lemon to see how bad an aussie show can be frankly i 'm ashamed,0
a group of tourists are stranded on snake island after an unfortunate accident with their boat they are forced to spend the night and as you probably suspected it is n't called snake island because it 's just soooooo much fun to say it has a history of people disappearing one by one because of the large snake population which is just what happens with these poor dumb souls this is a very boring and typical movie with tons of off screen snake attacks and lousy performances from nobody actors the only somewhat entertaining scene was an absolutely unnecessary and forced strip scene which ai n't anything could n't see in a pg13 rated movie folks if you are into snake movies than check out sssssss but do n't torture yourself with this crap,0
this is certainly a good film beautifully photographed and evocatively acted yet one should certainly criticize it and mizoguchi for it is not without flaws and weaknesses mizoguchi really cared for women and wanted to make statements on man 's lack of sympathy and total cruelty yet he sometimes gets ahead of himself in trying to make this statement by adopting the wrong means this is certainly a case in 'the crucified lovers 'princess yang kwei fei and 'zankiku monogatari he sets the scenario in feudal japan which leaves the viewer at the end with the partially right exclamation `` boy does feudalism suck i 'm glad that it is over ... '' and true some of the scenarios such weaker films of mizoguchi present would be literary impossible today also his women characters sometimes become archetypes of unrealistic self-sacrifice which also simplifies the scenario less appealing saying that `` crucified lovers '' is a good film with such few relative weaknesses though the sometimes chilly cynical prose by ueda the screenwriter helps this film allot i still highly prefer and recommend mizoguchi 's 'realistic 'contemprary films of 1936 'osaka elegy and 'sisters of the gion as well as his late masterpieces in which he showed more restraint and subtlety 'ugetsu 'sansho dayu and 'the life of oharu,1
a group of heirs to a mysterious old mansion find out that they have to live in it as part of a clause in the will or be disinherited but they soon find out of its history of everybody whom had lived there before them having either died in weird accidents or having had killed each other you 've seen it all before and this one is too low-budget and slow paced to be scary and does n't have any real surprises in the climax no special effects or gore to speak of in fact the only really amusing thing about the whole film is the quality of the english dubbing which at times is as bad as a cheap martial arts movie 3 out of 10 pretty low in the pecking order of 80 's haunted house movies,0
well i remember when the studio sacked schrader and hired harlin to do reshoots to this film they were quite right to do so dominion prequel to the exorcist is simply a bad movie it 's boring really it is it would be nice to think that the studio put aside a psychological masterpiece and that all those who in such big words condemned harlin 's version and praised schraders even if no one had ever seen it would have been right but they were n't to put it in a nutshell schrader has no idea what a horror film should be and it shows in a big way droll boring unintentionally funny in all the wrong places and bad supporting cast save your cash and your nerves do n't see it,0
i saw this movie on my flight from philly to denver the screen was three rows in front of me and about 12 '' x 10 '' so i really was n't going to watch it but i like malcolm in the middle so i thought i 'd watch just a few minutes next thing i know i 'm sucked in having a great time and was pleased as how good it was and how fast it seemed to make the time go by i agree with that the acting is very good for this level of entertainment being one of the older baby boomers i was also pleased to see lee majors with a role in the movie as with a couple of other actors who were famous jamiel `` yesterday '' but are out of the spotlight today poking fun at themselves it 's your basic `` kid is wronged kid gets even and then some and everyone enjoys themselves in the process '' no heavy thinking no great analysis needed just a good fun way to pass the time 3.5 out of 5,1
absolutely amazing humor up-beat music and an anti-war message make this probably the best movie i have ever seen first of all i love how clever this movie is particularly in the vietnam part of the plot it 's interesting how they make the army officials enforcing the draft look ridiculous follow that with the serious situation of the actual war and then the conclusion which leaves me seething with anger at the war and yet there is absolutely no violence on the screen wow also the music is really cool but what is very unique in this musical as opposed to evita or wizard of oz for example is that the lyrics do n't tell the story the mood does along with the visuals and between-songs-dialog `` donna '' is an upbeat song which emphasizes the happy mood whereas `` flesh failures '' has a driving intense beat in a minor key also i notice the lsd scene is not very flattering now i 'm definitely not going to do drugs not that i ever intended to all things considered this is an amazing movie the only negative comment i could say is that it 's sometimes hard to hear the dialog but who cares 10/10 stars,1
i am a longtime fan of the original of this movie bella martha/mostly martha and everything that makes that movie great and enjoyable to watch is missing from this one i miss the slow pace the build-up of characters and their style in small gestures the dominance of lights and moods and moves over dialog i do n't think that the story itself is enough martha/kate is more secluded and mario/nick is not a clown in most of the cases the things that makes one scene great in the original its is not working in its copy here the small alterations take away the tension my opinion is that you should go and see the original it 'll worth the inconvenience of subtitles,0
this is the result of the town of milpitas california making a home movie and subjecting the rest of the world to it legendary in some circles as the biggest cinematic turkey this movie is rightly thought of as a bad movie part comedy part giant monster horror movie this movie is full of non actors not acting the plot has something to do with a giant monster being created from the garbage and pollution in the area and going on a rampage the monster which we do n't see until the final 20 minutes is rather cool looking but is n't cool enough to warrant watching the preceding hour of boredom frankly even hardened bad movie lovers are going to have a tough time getting through to the end this is a stinker,0
i love ustinov 's distinctive literate narration and the photography is quiet nice we put the film on for our 3.5 year old who sort of wandered in and out of the room so for our first viewing we only saw about 1/3 of the movie and were quite charmed when we re-watched sitting down for family time we were all mortified at the violence and life-threatening situations the poor otter got into about halfway through the movie there 's a rack of dead bloody furry animals lots of blood not just a little then at the end there 's a wild struggle with a dog then blood clouds the water you 'd think given the g rating that 's all you 'll see ... that they will imply one of the animals died nope they drag the carcass out of the water and show it plainly for several traumatizing seconds personally as an adult i love horror movies and am fine with violent movies ala scorsese cronenberg tarantino heck i love the ultra violent battle royale but those are n't kid movies and do n't advertise themselves as such if you are deliberately raising your young ones to see the harsh realities of life for cute animals then this is the movie for you if you are like me and my wife though you might want to spare your child nightmares and avoid this one,0
angels and demons 3 out of 10 clearly something bad has happened to ron howard i do n't know what exactly but something has gone very wrong howard has always been a decent workman director while he will never be mistaken for an artistic savant both cinderella man and apollo 13 were excellent films parenthood was pretty good and even angels and demons prequel/sequel the da vinci code was a fun romp in addition none of his films have been downright awful note i have seen neither how the grinch stole christmas nor his newest film heidi montag says no to plastic whats more howard managed to hold this quality is such devise genres as star driven oscar bait a beautiful mind star driven costume drama far and away star driven revenge fantasy ransom and comedies about prostitution and mermaids night shift splash angels and demons is at its center a poorly directed and shot film scenes are too dark camera angles are all wrong the actors block each others shots and the whole affair is often out of focus this makes the telling of an already confusing story even more muddled dan brown gets picked on a lot but i found the da vinci code a fun readable romp so sue me the movie version of the da vinci code kept the same where are they going to next vibe of the book and added an attractive cast and attractive location shooting angels and demons however takes place in the claustrophobic confines of vatican city and since howard was n't allowed to film in many of the real locations we end up with a lot of running around a cgi back lot the entire film is as if rick steves did a vatican city special and instead of actually visiting the holy city and pointing his camera rick had to use lego bricks and a second hand art book with all the tits erased while the da vinci code had what i still think is an intriguing central mystery again sue me demons and angels story consists of a plot by the illuminati roll eyes now to destroy the vatican their idea was to take positions in schools for the deaf around the world and raping every student in the ass repeatedly oops my bad apparently the vatican does n't need any help on that one anyway their plan is to infiltrate europe 's large hadron collider kill the head priest and steal three vials of anti-matter this begs more than a few questions can the hadron collider create anti-matter can you capture the anti-matter once created why is the eu collecting it perhaps they fear a godzilla attack why is the head of anti-matter gathering a vatican priest now once they get the anti-matter they are going to use its incredible destructive power to take over the world no just kidding unfortunately the illuminati have n't quite grasped that pinky and the brain level of sophistication just yet instead the current pope has just died and it 's conclave time the top seeded cardinals for the final four pope tournament are all kidnapped and the illuminati are killing them one by one seven style they being good sports however are leaving clues at every murder like some latin themed riddler oh and the last kidnapped cardinal has the anti-matter and if he is n't found in time rick steves will have to go straight to venice next year to see decent frescoes if only there was some latin themed batman to save the day okay the story is truly awful and it is poorly told but maybe this is one of those films saved by great performances a true character study okay you know where this is going tom hanks gives an incredibly wooden performance and simply looks awful he is also to old to play the character by about twenty years his love interest israeli actress ayelet zurer has zero chemistry with either hanks or the screen ewan macgregor plays the pope 's personal assistant/cabana boy as an irish man who looks like he is about to break into a musical number at any moment providing no one steals his lucky charms on the plus side stellan skarsgård puts in a fine turn as head of vatican security and as far as we know no deaf children were raped during the making of this film which puts it ahead of its vatican critics in at least one area,0
`` tourist trap '' is an odd thriller that came out in the 70 's it 's about 5 friends molly jocelyn jones jerry jon van hess eileen robin sherwood becky tanya roberts and woody kevin mcdermott who stumble upon a cloesd down museum slausen 's lost oasis a curious and eerie roadside museum this goldmine of decaying but strangely life-like mannequins is run by slausen chuck conners an eccentric but seemingly harmless has-been slausen has one warning for the youngsters stay away from davey slausen 's reclusive and disturbed brother the youngsters curiosity gets the best of them and they go exploring the trap is sprung amidst flying objects slamming doors scarves that strangle on their own empowered by some hidden force the trap slowly closes in on the group the `` creature '' davey and his army of murderous mannequins make quick and brutal work of the friends until only one remains although not a slasher movie `` tourist trap '' still contains elements of slasher movies such as the chase scenes and the stalking and the fact the killer wears a mask the seemingly telekinetic abilities of the killer to lock bolts and animate the wax dummies is used to great effect perhaps the scariest thing about this movie are the mannequins which are admittedly scary enough to start off with but are rally spooky here the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget these wax figures are blatantly plastic shop dummies- but this only goes to serve as even more eerie when their eyes move with an incredible human the acting is actually pretty good chuck conners gives a well rounded and creepy performance as mr slausen jocelyn jones is great as the female lead,1
it is hard to screw up this story great book / good film version from fred zinneman yet this film is awful first the casting was terrible richard gere should of played the jackal himself as edward fox was a similar type of cypher and they did n't need to mess with the original script by adding so much worthless expensive fluff this film reminded me of so many bruce willis films as you see huge expense with nothing cinematic to show for it it is his `` conspiracy theory '' it takes some real doing to make a film this bad from such a fine original script every person from michael caton jones down should be banned from making films for 10 years such is the insult this film is to real filmmakers were hollywood to go on trial for having no idea what they were doing this film would be exhibit a. shame on you all,0
as americans we have come to expect crapiness as `` par for the course '' when it comes to horror and unknown directors directing unknown actors acting for unknown writers we truly expect this to suck when they do n't suck it becomes an over night success this is not an over night success nor is it an over the weekend or over the month success this blows from start to finish and my only recommendation is this go into this knowing it sucks enjoy it for what it is for what it is n't if you have something better to do keep this on the back way back burner it 's entertaining in the way watching the elderly cross a busy street during rush hour but do n't expect much-they almost never get hit by an actual car its just a lot of hoopla,0

ok let 's start with saying that when a dutch movie is bad it 's really bad rarely something with a little bit of quality comes along lek karakter here in holland but not often costa is about 4 girls going to spain to go on vacation party get drunk get laid u know the drill it 's also about the world of clubbers or proppers pro 's who 're trying to lure the crowd into their club i 'm not sure how long it took to write the script but i suspect somewhere between 15 minutes and 20 minutes because you 're watching a bunch of random scenes for 90 minutes long nothing and i mean nothing is believable in this movie it 's almost too riduculous for words what happens with the storyline suddenly the movie transforms into a sort of karate action thing with a one-on-one fight with 'the bad guy in black and cliche car chase scenes trough a watertank-car can it be more cheesy also the words character-development and casting are unfamiliar to the makers after having seen `` traffic '' 3 days before this i fell from sheer brilliance from a piece of art to this this is film-making at it 's saddest and do n't start about low budget because even with a low budget you could write a better script it almost seems that the film-makers were too busy partying themselves to make a decent movie anyway the chicks in the water at the end made it up a little bit but for the rest of it do n't waste your money on such garbage,0
the film 's title makes it sound like a porno but it 's not even a sex comedy instead hot summer in barefoot county is about an official sent from a southern state to a small town to locate and arrest moonshiners the moonshine though is coming from the farm of an old woman with three beautiful daughters almost anyone can guess what happens next but oddly the film is very tame it hardly even qualifies for a pg rating what 's more the low budget is obvious in pretty much every shot and the acting is sooooo amateurish this film was probably intended for the drive-in crowd but it 's unlikely that it satisfied them even in 1974,0
excellent drama about 2 alienated spoiled punks who go afoul of the federal government each for his own reasons one a druggie just wants to score some bucks for his next fix but the other has a far more sinister agenda fueled in part by a resentment of his father good performances and a hot script makes this a winner,1
the best of everything is a high gloss large screen soap opera which follows the careers of four career women hope lange suzy parker diane baker and martha hyer at a new york publishing firm what 's the best for some women is not necessarily the best for all presiding over this group of young fillies is wise old mare joan crawford who 's been around the track a few times on screen and in real life she looks right at home as the boss lady as well she should have at this point around the time she was making the best of everything joan crawford became a widow when her fourth husband alfred steele died it was a particularly traumatic event for her she woke up one morning and found him dead in bed next to her she inherited all of his stock in pepsi cola where he was the board chairman and during the same period as the best of everything was being made she wound up the queen bee at pepsi cola life does sometimes imitate art so that authority as she barks out dictation and coffee orders to hope lange rings real true in fact all the women here with the exception of lange are in for some rough sledding it 's rough for lange too but she literally makes the best of everything what a collection of stinkers the men are in this film the best of them stephen boyd is a heavy drinker the others louis jourdan robert evans and brett halsey are as slimy a collection of rodents as ever gathered for one film i ca n't forget brian aherne either who 's the fanny pinching head of this publishing firm half that office would have sexual harassment suits going today some nice location shots of new york in the fifties make the film a real treat catch it by all means,1
this is a very moving film that takes a new twist on somewhere we 've all been a relationship as it 's about to end kristen thomson 's performance as tessa desperately trying to hold onto her connection with bobby for just one more day is extremely convincing and moving and takes you right into the story who has n't been faced with the end of a relationship and at least wanted to shout out tearfully `` just one more night '' when he does give her one more night the journey that these two people share makes you pause and think about how precious every truly close relationship can be and how each one whether permanent or not should be treated with respect rather than simply thrown away,1
this almost perfect cinematic rendition of edith nesbit 's popular children 's novel follows the lives of roberta bobbie phyllis and peter and their mother after their father is unfairly accused of treason and sent to prison they go to live in an almost uninhabitable house in the country which stands near a railway line  mum writes stories to make enough money for food and candles while the children spend much of their time around the railway station and specifically waving to one particular train to 'send their love to father always an involving and clever novel the characters are here brought to life under the perceptive direction of lionel jeffries better known as a fine character actor jenny agutter plays bobbie while sally thomsett and gary warren are her sister and brother their mother is dinah sheridan while the other memorable characters are played by bernard cribbins perks the railway-man and william mervyn the old gentleman on the train 'the railway children is gentle entertainment from another age but does its job beautifully as we watch bobbie grow up with the worries of an absent parent jostling against her own needs both to be alone and to have fun we can only rejoice when events come together at the close of the picture throughout we have a sense of time and place  be it from the steam trains the university paper chase or the red flannelette petticoats worn by the girls and used to avert disaster,1
this movie had terrible acting terrible plot and terrible choice of actors leslie nielsen ... come on the one part i considered slightly funny was the battling fbi/cia agents but because the audience was mainly kids they did n't understand that theme,0
having already seen the original `` jack frost '' i never thought that `` jack frost 2 '' would be as absurd as it is boy was i wrong then again a-pix movies have a way of showing unbelievably bad material even worse than you might expect i believe this is the first a-pix sequel and it may be an indication of what to expect in the future more a-pix sequels it 's hard to watch this without laughing especially during the later parts of the movie in which jack frost 's offspring which are essentially snowballs with eyes arms a mouth and sharp teeth start killing people with the typical comedic dialogue and silly voices to go with it they are shown both as puppets with a stick underneath to move them and as computer animation which i have to say looks very cheesy the computer animation surprised me as the first `` jack frost '' had no such effects i 'd strongly recommend that you see the original `` jack frost '' before seeing this one both of which it would be preferable to watch with a group of friends to get the full amusement out of it and because it would make more sense `` sense '' being a relative term now only if there was `` uncle sam 2 '' ...,0
just ingenious enough to be plausible and still a lot of fun this is a pure slice of the 1970s even the cops need haircuts badly shot in and around london the plot of the american ex-con who tries going straight but finds himself sent as an electrician to a bank in mayfair and then has the screws put on by crime lord david niven and finds himself plotting the crime of the century is well-handled i liked its simplicity and even innocence it harks back to a time when caper films where just that a caper and violence was n't a part of the deal all in all you could do a lot worse than watch this it has enough twists and turns to give it some oomph and a cast that obviously had fun making it nicely made and watchable,1
this is perhaps the worst movie i have ever seen and i have seen well over 300 movies in my lifetime the acting atrocious the only bright spot seems to be judging the anatomical prowess of the female castmembers after watching this movie it is suggested that the viewer not operate heavy machinery or go driving for a period of at least 24 hours also a bottle of valium would be recommended so you do n't feel so bad for the 100 wasted minutes of your life the plot is nothing original the dialog excruciating and even the weapons seem sub-par do yourself a favor and go to your local blockbuster and burn whatever copies they have of this horrid film,0
dead man 's bounty the film 's american title has the look and feel of a classic italian western the cinematography costumes and sets look great the cast is rugged not a pretty face among them at the beginning i was preparing for a pretty cool movie but what i eventually witnessed was an absolute disaster the script was perfectly dreadful there was no suspense whatsoever and very little action or worthwhile drama despite looking great the cast spoke english with heavy european accents that were often unintelligible the final nail in it 's coffin was the broad streak of pretentiousness that paints most of the picture focusing heavily on the character of the barmaid who 's featured in a couple of very awkward sex scenes also her speech near the end was pretty repugnant the only novelty comes from the stunt casting of val kilmer in the role of the dead man continuing his recent string of doa performances,0
james cagney racketeer and political ward heeler get to become a deputy commissioner of corrections and visits a boys reform school the catch is that cagney is not in it for the graft he genuinely wants to make a difference in the lives of the kids there because he comes from a background like their 's the villain of the piece is dudley digges who is a grafting chiseler and a sanctimonious hypocrite to boot one of the subtexts of the plot of the mayor of hell is that these kids are mostly immigrants and those that judge them and are in positions of power are those who are here a few generations note in the mess hall scene as digges offers a prayer of thanks for the food they are about to receive digges is eating well but the kids are getting quality you would n't feed to your pet cagney has his own troubles back in the city with some of his henchmen and he has to take it on the lam that puts digges back in charge and setting up the film for it 's climax the mayor of hell was a typical product from the working class studio and because it was pre-code it gets pretty gruesome at times a later version of this crime school with humphrey bogart and the dead end kids was a more sanitized remake although cagney is fine in the lead role as is madge evans the school nurse the acting honors go to dudley digges hard to believe that the same man could portray the drunken but kindly one legged ship 's surgeon in mutiny on the bounty but digges is a fine player and a joy to watch in every film he 's in this film is not shown to often because of the racial and ethnic stereotypes it portrays a whole lot of minorities would be offended today still it 's a fine film interestingly enough a few years ago the film sleepers came out and it touched on some of the same issues i guess films about reform schools do n't change in any time,1
crossfire remains one of the best hollywood message movies because unlike the admirably intentioned gentleman 's agreement which it beat to theatres by a few months it chooses to send its message via the form an excellent noir thriller rather than have an outraged star constantly saying `` it 's because i 'm jewish is n't it '' it 's much easier to get the message that hate is like a loaded gun across when the dead bodies are actual rather than metaphorical somewhat shamefully the brief featurette on the warners dvd does n't mention that novelist richard brooks disowned the film over the shift from a homophobic murder to an anti-semitic one but it 's interesting to note that while the victim is killed primarily because he is jewish there 's little doubt in sam levene 's performance that the character is in fact also gay  not a mincing caricature but there 's definitely a two lost souls aspect to his scenes with george cooper 's confused soldier there 's not much of a mystery to who the murderer is even though the killing is carried out in classic noir shadows the body language of the killer is instantly recognisable but then the film has its characters drift to the same conclusion before the halfway point the tension comes from proving it and saving the fall guy there 's an element of ealing films to the gang of soldiers teaming together to get their buddy out of a fix you could almost see that aspect as a blueprint for hue and cry but the atmosphere is pure rko noir set over one long sweltering night the film has a great look filled with deep dark blacks and shadows born as much out of economy as style it cut back on lighting time and allowed director edward dmytryk more time to work with the actors and the excellent cast make the most of the fine script a laid-back but quietly charismatic robert mitchum robert young 's maigret-like detective gloria grahame 's tramp and the perpetually creepy paul kelly as her compulsive liar admirer a guy who tries on stories the way other people try on ties but the lasting impression is of robert ryan 's excellent performance as a guy who could do with a good leaving alone as he does his best to help the wrongly accused man all the way to death row a big surprise hit in 1946 as a reward dmytryk and producer adrian scott found themselves investigated by the huac which itself had a notable tendency to target jews so much for crusading,1
dark reality is a saw like movie that is slightly decrepit while the plot and story are good there is a little too much unnecessary nudity while i feel the film was technically well done the acting was spotty it was just a little too dark for my mood while i was watching it it basically says that there are a lot of missing people out there that will never be found and are perhaps being tortured by sick whackos i feel that some information on the captors and their reasons for being so sick would have helped some it came of as a snuff film just made for the violent content if you like to see women beaten tortured and killed then this is for you if you 're looking for something a little liter and more expressive and reasoned skip this one,0
family guy is easily one of the worst shows i 've ever forced myself to watch not at the bottom though i 've seen the jersey shore a popular hit with high school and college kids who mistake immaturity for edginess this show is unoriginal and stale as this has been dubbed a comedy show let 's take a look at its `` humor '' 1. random flashbacks/cuts to celebrities or movies or politics or anything that can be cut to for a knee-jerk laugh it got old after the 5 or so repetitions per episode simple solution every time you hear `` this is worse than/like the time ... '' plug your ears 2. inappropriateness for its own sake this show is notorious for inserting inappropriate gags that have little to do with the overall plot solution watch south park they did it right the bottom line is that family guy is not worth your time and does n't hold a candle to the simpsons,0
this is another of my favorite columbos it sports a top-notch cast including john cassavetes who was never handsomer or sexier anjanette comer myrna loy and blythe danner now here 's something i 've always wondered had gwenyth paltrow been born when this episode was shot or was danner pregnant at the time thanks to imdb i have my answer she was five months pregnant now i can really feel ancient cassavetes plays a brilliant conductor whose marriage to danner was apparently to use the social connections of her mother loy he has a mistress on the side anjanette comer a prominent pianist but she announces she wants more she 's sick of being back street on the night of their concert he gets rid of her and makes it look like suicide columbo picks up a few problems immediately one thing he notices `` you have a beautiful woman here bedroom eyes she has money a body and a career where 's the man '' it 's wonderful to see falk and good friend cassavetes together there 's a very funny episode at the vet with columbo 's bassett everyone in the cast is great this is one of the episodes that made columbo the classic series it became,1
this is just what we need a show about the people nobody likes in high school or in university man or woman people objectifying others and congratulating themselves for doing so is exactly the opposite of intelligent thinking and this show is just disgusting for doing exactly that so four men sit in chairs and watch two other guys try and pick up women to have sex with them and in the end one of the two wins great ... just f-n great i 'm also supposed to accept these four douche bags as being `` judges '' of people 's `` game '' the term `` game '' has got to be the most moronic thing to come out of modern english since the term `` bling bling '' added to the fact that these men are called the `` experts '' just makes me want to throw up whats left of my respect for modern culture these are not god damn role models they are the result of mtv culture coming to bite us in the ass if you enjoy the bullshit spilling out the sides of this monstrosity then you probably think paris hilton and britany spears have talent its not true and you should be ashamed of yourself for thinking so and for all those people who will say that i would like this better if i got laid or that i 'm just jealous go screw yourself because its obvious that a real girl certainly wo n't,0
i just saw `` eagle´s wing '' i do not really know why this movie was made what is the message of this story nevertheless i liked it there are some exciting scenes in it i appreciate a strong performance by martin sheen harvey keitel is less convincing,1
from the start this film drags and drags clumsy overdubs explaining the history monochrome acting boring sets total lack of any humanity verve or style the actors look as if they are drugged potentially an interesting story completely wasted surely somebody realised how bad it was at some point in producing it,0
i expected this movie to be absolutely god awful like `` what dreams may come '' or `` the truman show '' or something well they were selling it off for £3.99 in my local hmv and it had giovanni ribisi on the cover you know you cant help but love him and so my friends dared me to buy it and i was sure it was going to be trash maybe thats the only reason i could sit through this movie because my standards were never that high,0
hahahahah probably one of the funniest movies i 've even seen obviously this is n't intentional though it takes about half the movie for the main characters to realize what the big hilly thing is in the middle of the city is spewing hot red stuff and the other half spent diverting the lave flow through the city using fire trucks yer right it certainly made me laugh the acting makes arnie look like a rsc thespian it is amazing that films like this get commissioned a more interesting version would be someone going near an active volcano and filming it and would probably cost about £20 to make 40 i can see some guy pitching the film to a film company `` well there 's this big volcano and it erupts in a city .... pretty radical hey '' if you can find it in the dollar bins maybe worth buying as after watching this most other films would look good,0
i was quite impressed with the narration by martha and how it pulled on the emotional heartstrings of the audience as well as how it must have impacted the family the forward-backward motion of the storyline was well-done and normally i do n't enjoy movies with the flash-back/flash-forward effects i felt during the whole evolution of the movie that `` surely tommy did it '' it leaves you with a sense of how these people lived their lives almost totally devoid of each other and the consequences of not having any desire to answer the question `` it 's 10 o'clock do you know where your children are '' and furthermore `` what the heck are they doing '' or `` do i care '' rich spoiled brats literally getting away with murder or so they thought .......,1
treat williams reached a degree of stardom with this movie and really squandered it do n't be led astray by his poor movie choices since this movie really stands out `` hair '' is a musical that really deals with the attitude and probably more so with the persona of the famed peace movement of the 60 's there is a lot of spectacular music done in spectacular fashion unlike the music videos of the late 70 's 80 's and 90 's the video flashes coincide with the subject matter of the music in other words the video makes sense when matched with the songs so you know it never could 've made it on mtv the subject matter dwells on drugs and being hippies but it mostly an anti war movie dealing with the senseless tragedies of viet nam one of the protagonists is an oklahoma boy intent on making a difference believing all the patriotic dribble he is spoon fed and he happens upon a gang in new york who are more or less glorified hoodlums their characters are very unique and probably would n't make sense today but this bunch bands together by burning their draft cards what ensues in some spectacular scenery and mesmerizing scenes involving not only the three leads but the other 3 gang members as well as a newcomer with a small child whose entrance is easily one of the ten grandest entrances of all time in cinema partly because she sings one of the greatest songs of that generation despite their faults you come to love these people a cinematic triumph with a heart felt and grand finale,1
you know those films that are blatantly awful but you ca n't help but love them well that 's what evil ed is possibly the best awful film in the world the sound is rubbish the dubbing is crap the screenplay is nonsense and the special effects are pap however i ca n't help but love this film dearly and i have recommended it to at least 50 people over the years sam campbell or the guy who plays him should be featured on the actor 's studio series as he is that memorable possibly the greatest movie villain not named tony montana seriously if you do n't expect a lot then you wo n't be disappointed keep a light-hearted approach to watching this film and you 'll soon rate it a ten afterwards,1
i have just seen caribe a couple of nights ago at the annual vistas film festival held here in dallas and i must express my discontent the opening caption tries to tell us that the film is a portrayal of the current invasion of south american countries costa rica in this particular case by north american oil companies and the negative effects both economic and environmental of this invasion the main characters are a married couple who live a simple pleasant life maintaining a banana farm right away a woman arrives and announces that she is the wife 's half-sister i 'm not going to go into specifics about this and to be honest i do n't feel that i 'm spoiling anything with this review yet another key point is that the company to whom they distribute their bananas drops them due to budget demands in a poor economy so the main conflict that is supposed to be addressed in the movie is of the husband between the rock and the hard place trying to preserve his livelihood on one hand the reynolds oil company has basically offered him employment and financial compensation basically a bribe to use his public influence to encourage the town to allow the company to begin drilling in their town compromising his standing with the community and the community itself on the other hand he is faced with being dead broke but on the side of his community protesting the drilling given the length of this film it would have been ample time to explore the issues just described but it just does n't happen and i 'll tell you why you will notice that this film has won a couple of awards so far one for direction and an audience award i 'm not going to pick apart esteban 's direction it was n't bad or good enough for me to be all that passionate about writing anything the audience award was at a film festival in spain and for it to gain an audience award i 'd have to imagine that spanish people just dig soap operas in fact central and south america dig soap operas as well i know that much i assume that esteban was either aiming to take advantage of this or that he himself digs soap operas because that is what unfolds over the course of this film so much to the point that it kicks the whole oil company plot to the side almost as if they imagined halfway through the making of this film that it had become tiresome because it seems like at least three of the supporting characters have had their back story and character development severely compromised to make room for more sex and crying scenes the only true villain in the movie is one of these three characters and at no point do you actually get to find out who the hell he is it 's almost as if they cut his screen time just short of taking him out of the film entirely from time to time they toy with the oil against community plot but these are digressions at best what we see a lot more of are scenes of passion jealousy betrayal adultery etc these themes saturate the story to such a degree that the oil company 'sub'plot becomes unnecessary it 's almost as if this was a stunt to legitimize a romantic drama soap opera by throwing in a little political relevance nevertheless the film gets so caught up in the romance that it ultimately does n't know what to do with itself resulting in an ending so tacked on that you 're left wondering what it is that you 've been waiting around for or if there was ever anything to begin with here are two things that i think could have saved this movie either cut out the half-sister or cut out the oil company it 's obvious which one of the two they were more interested in or perhaps if caribe had been an hour longer they could have worked this all out regardless i 'd have been fine with a straight-up soap opera and i think that the subject of oil companies exploiting foreign nations is in dire need of addressing by the film community caribe is both and neither these two angles could have worked together had they been balanced accordingly but with a romantic plot running around in circles and taking up almost twice as much time as necessary at the expense of an oil plot that 's barely been established to begin with both sides suffer best of all the romance plot is never even resolved i 'd like to say i 'd watch this movie again to see what i 've missed but i have a strong feeling that i already know what it is as far as i 'm concerned it would n't matter if i saw caribe ten more times i 've missed it because it is simply not there,0
as usual another masterpiece in the vice academy series hahaha i do n't know why they even bothered to make this trash just another series of cops acting slutty a defining part was when ginger lynn allen 's character holly wells and elizabeth kaitan 's character candy tried to seduce the scientist by wearing nothing but their bra and underwear under their labcoats just a wonderful scene ha a character that i did n't like was the commissioner he was very annoying and ignorant they should have arrested him mrs. devonshire was pretty annoying as well they should have stopped this series after this movie,0
1 hour and 40 minutes of talking -- boring talking and more talking and then some it is hard for me to grasp how an actress like anne parillaud who shone superbly in femme fatale would sign up for such a piece of crap unbelievable if you need a nightcap this movie might help although i would prefer some nice classical music unfortunately i just found out that i have to write 10 lines for my comment to appear -- that 's almost as unbelievable so short and succinct one or two sentence commentaries expressing one 's core take on a movie is not enough geez people i made my point and do n't to waste your time with more unnecessary words -- as this movie does wolfgang,0
not being a particular fan of westerns i watched this primarily because i wanted to see lucille ball in something other than an `` i love lucy '' or `` lucy show '' type of role here she plays christine larson owner of a saloon in the arizona territory in 1868 who 's about to be married to the unscrupulous local indian agent dean jagger ball 's performance was ok nothing really more than that she did n't blow me away it succeeded for me in that the role was very different from what i 'm accustomed to seeing her in there was very little of the outrageous physical comedy she later became famous for although the movie tried to maintain a gently amusing feel throughout a typical funny line `` there 's two ways to deal with women and no one knows either one of them '' i did n't find the story all that compelling although i appreciated that the indians were shown as the victims of the indian agent there 's typical shootout action and a lot of horses your typical western in other words as to christine we pretty much can guess from the beginning how her planned marriage is going to end up it 's just a question of how she 's going to get there if you like westerns this would be a pretty typical one with a bit of humour thrown in if you 're not big on the genre this will be lacking i 'm not big on the genre 3/10,0
awful waste of time there is no camp or trash value in this one seen better amateur movies done by 10 to 12 years old kids in movie clubs how on earth someone can spoil movie about vampires and lesbians it 's not a movie to put together a few vampire / sadomasochism enthusiast in a same room and just shoot it could not find anything good about the film there was no plot no real actors no real special effects no humor a few overweight goths touching each other can not be called a sex scene nothing at all well cemetery was nice but one should shot a vampire movie during dark purpose was probably good make a trash movie in a spirit of ed wood problem is that one can not make a bad movie intentionally it takes talent and an effort to make a `` real '' movie ed wood might have lacked money but he sure had effort these guys lacked everything ed wood was a genius compared to these guys,0
someone definitely has it in for the wind and i can not believe that what i saw on the screen has much to do with it this is a better and more solid movie than most of the independents i watch all year long the cinematography displays a genuine love and mastery of the craft and the casting was just fine i would love to see more of these folks especially zeke rippy as far as the story and script i 'm not so sure that the negative comments preceding this post were written with the intent of informing anybody else about the movie the long drawn out nit-picky bashing posts that must have taken hours to compose and are the only comments ever left for any movie on this site by the reviewer are obvious slander directed at the producers of the film i do n't know the inside story but it would probably make a good movie what i do know from being around this biz is productions that try to make everybody happy usually end up being awful and when the filmmaker has the guts drive and common sense to `` kill the babies '' someone always ends up with hurt feelings that 's part of the biz too and one of the finest learning tools available to those truly dedicated to making it in the movie business of course the failures have nothing better to do than to sit at home and write false reviews on the internet as a form of vendetta against those that snubbed them read were honest and truthful with them and that is my best guess to explain the nasty nasty reviews in as much as there is a grain of truth behind everything there is a point to be made but these exaggerations of the grains are so over the top that they become obviously fictitious it 's not a slasher blood bath if that 's what you 're looking for it 's more the psychological suspense thriller which typically is not appreciated by the lowest common denominators out there the best way to see this movie is to try to expunge any pre-conceived notions pop it in and let it unfold seriously characters are defined by their actions and words and when you see what these people do and what they say i do n't think you can come away with the conclusion that these characters were poorly developed poorly understood perhaps overall i do agree that this is a nicely done compelling movie perhaps i would not have given it a 9 under normal circumstances but the severe negative comments actually attracted me to the picture i have a secret love for really bad cinema to me the ratings below 5 should be reserved for the shlocky inept poorly acted and stupidly written movies none of that applies here it is quality movie making with some real talent in there i gave it the nine to to tip the scales back in the correct direction watch the movie and tell me i am wrong,1
from 1996 first i watched this movie i feel never reach the end of my satisfaction i feel that i want to watch more and more until now my god i do n't believe it was ten years ago and i can believe that i almost remember every word of the dialogues i love this movie and i love this novel absolutely perfection i love willem defoe he has a strange voice to spell the words `` black night '' and i always say it for many times never being bored i love the music of szararem it 's so much spiritualistic made me come into another world deep in my heart anyone can feel what i feel and anyone could make the movie like this i do n't believe so thanks ondaatje thanks mingela,1
tourist trap 1979 is an entertaining horror movie from the late 70 's the movie is about a bunch of young friends who get stranded on an old deserted lane by a creepy old waxwork museum the owner of the museum seems like a strange but harmless old man but things take a very nasty turn when members of the young group start getting killed off who is responsible for the murders is it old man slausen or is it his collection of creepy mannequins who seem to be alive and hungry for blood this film was good stuff it was fast faced the performances were very good from the actors/actresses tanya roberts was very sexy and the film was never boring and like i say it had some very creepy scenes so be prepared to hide under the covers definitely recommended to horror movie/ghost story fans i give this film a highly respectable 7.2 out of 10,1
the salena incident is by far the director dustin rikert 's best film -- which is n't saying much in his past films and i use the term `` films '' loosely the director takes ideas from hollywood blockbusters and severely marginalizes them the salena incident is no different the movie is basically con air meets aliens done with the semblance of your average film school production the film is riddled with out-of-focus shots and plagued by special effects that would have trouble rivaling most high school computer animation classes for example almost every on-screen explosion is the same fire effect matted over the screen the weak effects and production value are only compromised by a flawed plot and rocky dialogue in a sentence the story strings together like an exposition of overused hollywood clichés the movie begins with the worst cgi alien ship ever made crashing into the worst cgi earth ever made and a team of army somethings going down to investigate next a bus of prison transports carrying the worst of the worst from across the state is overthrown by the prisoners with the help of their blonde girlfriends armed with silicon implants the prisoners escape and run into the town of salena where they encounter the aliens who ... shock ... have escaped from an alien prison transport carrying the worst of the worst from across the galaxy the prisoners and their captive police armed with only guns and sad puns have to fight off the aliens and escape the town before the international space alliance rolls eyes bombs the city into oblivion the only real enjoyable parts of the movie are when the actors who are clearly undermined by the script are given the freedom to improvise and also when they fight off the smaller of the alien creatures in a flurry of gun fire other than that the movie really is n't worth anyone 's time let alone the plastic that the dvd is made out of how awful was it let 's just say the secretary of defense is about 90 years old works in a room that is about as high tech 1950 's real estate office and is wearing a looney tunes tie yes if that was n't clear enough before the man in charge of the pentagon is wearing a tie with bugs bunny and the road runner on it the movie basically culminates hahahahhaaa did i say culminates ... with the last remaining soldier running into the group of prisoners and guards and the new formed team fighting their way away from the vicious aliens -- which for some strange reason leads them straight back to the alien ship yeah ... the movie has heart but is riddled with horrible direction and even worse camera work someone seriously needed to slap the dp and tell him there is more to cinematography than repetitive stagnant chest-level shots this movie really is n't worth renting if it ever makes it that far being that it 's not as horribly bad as the last films made by the director which reduces the laugh-ability but it 's nowhere near watchable cinema,0
i mistakenly thought that this neo-noir effort from the buffalo niagara falls area might be something different unfortunately i was incorrect there are are many problems with `` the falls '' that really have nothing to do with it 's low budget video production immediately one has to question why all the constant narration my feeling is that if you have a decent script the audience will follow along without having to be insulted with voice over storytelling the acting is very amateurish which is not unexpected but simply adds to the problems finally the entire thing is annoyingly shot like an mtv music video which i found to be totally unacceptable the narration bad acting and annoying video effects are all good reasons why this should be avoided merk,0
i 've seen lonesome dove dead man 's walk and the streets of laredo and now the return to lonesome dove if you are hungry for more after watching lonesome dove this 'll fill yer belly great cast great story most definitely a close second to lonesome dove i will be purchasing this movie to add to my collection this is the best or at least my favorite performance by jon voight he is captain call lou gossett jr. playing isom pickett is not somebody i 'd mess with he is a bad ass with perspective william peterson does a great job as well rick schroder is back as newt with an angst filled performance that reminds me of his stint on nypd blue my only problem with this film and it 's really picking nits is that i had the impression that call wanted to be `` the first man to graze cattle in montana '' and it 's obvious that dunnigan had already been there a while a little inconsistent but easily overlooked as you lose yourself in the fantastic tale i especially love the apparent character growth of jasper fant and july johnson i 've watched this movie several times and am ready for another sequel,1
so i rented this movie hoping to learn about the democratic republic of congo drc and the beginnings of its independence from belgian rule i was excited to become familiar with the figures involved in its history mainly lumumba and mobutu i wanted to see how the new congolese government attempted to bring together the various groups opposing colonial rule the political motives behind each one the reasons behind belgium 's decision to give the drc its independence and also how the united states and the former ussr were involved sadly all of my questions went largely unanswered my belief is that this movie was made by people who through a passing familiarity with the story of the drc 's fight for freedom saw a story filled with drama and emotion and decided to exploit it they then proceeded to try and stuff all the dramatic points into a storyline briefly filled them out with dialogue went to the set and shot it i could be wrong but if so it 's all the sadder because then the makers must have simply become too tied up in getting everything in and ended up glossing over all details in an effort to create an encompassing history whatever the reason the fact is that the movie could be a timeline of sentence-long statements and facts printed on the screen the film goes through each major occurrence and tells the viewer point-blank the main idea of what 's going on completely smoothing over the actual details in favor of getting across the big things for instance there is the scene when lumumba is captured by the increasingly rebellious army controlled by mobutu in the situation the soldiers have three possible viewpoints one that sympathizes with lumumba one that vilifies lumumba and one that stands in the middle sympathizing and yet obeying orders correspondingly there are three soldiers that speak in the scene uttering lines that unadornedly show their points of view then to avoid dealing with the actual tensions that these opposing viewpoints bring up the scriptwriters simply inserted some random shooting more army guys show up and they just end up beating everyone up this is the extent of the reflectiveness of the movie most of the time each character simply states their basic motives the other characters respond with theirs and that 's that there 's little telling through actions even the things they say are direct the point of painfulness it 's hard to believe that the people represented actually acted like that also in the trend of this directness things like political tension between factions is reduced to simple acknowledgement of the fact -- we never learn what these factions are what they 're fighting for their power basically anything except that they exist the characters likewise are one-dimensional and flat unfortunately i do n't know whether lumumba was actually a freedom fighter passionately devoted to ideals of congolese unity but after an hour or so of the movie i certainly did n't trust it to tell me so the drc like many developing countries has a complicated and important history especially in the period leading up to and after independence but the telling of these histories will not be useful unless there is recognition of the intricacy of the situations lumumba fails to give proper attention to these details and ends up telling the viewer little except the most general of outlines,0
i watched six of a kind for w.c. fields he 's only in it for around 10 minutes and has one long scene the infamous pool sequence he made famous in vaudeville and several other great moments the reamaining 55 minutes are also delightful thankfully mostly due to the hilarious charlie ruggles as the bumbling banker j. pinkham whinney he is everyone 's foil he stutters and stumbles about to our pleasure also his comedy partner mary boland plays his wife flora joining in the proceedings are george burns and gracie allen boland is particularly funny near the beginning and near the end but gracie and ruggles use up most of the picture gracie 's funny quite but she can also get tiring and poor george burns has absolutely nothing to do except repeat gracie all the time i do n't remember laughing at him once although he has one great scene with ruggles where ruggles tries desperately to get george to take gracie and leave him and his wife alone for a while and one with fields where he asks fields to sell him a sweater that bit is exclusively fields though the situation is constantly funny the whinneys are going to drive to california but to help them with expenses george and gracie are recruited 8/10,1
over the years some of them most enjoyable films have been about dysfunctional families bonjour monsieur sholmi is such a film this is an isreali film about a moroccan jewish family this could be about any family in any culture we all know or would want to know people like those in this comic gem this 2003 delight was written directed by shemi zorkin let us hope he a long career the movie is seen through the eyes of the 16 year old son who seems to be concerned with everyone in the family heis brilliantly played by oshri cohen he was 18 when he made the movie he has been in a few since i know i will hunt them up hopefully this young man will become an international star the entire cast is magnificent i do hope i see them again i loved every person in the cast to some degree.i think all who see this will agree it has been nominated for many international awards has won 8 it deserved every one now being a film in a language besides english it had a very limited run in the usa which i feel is regrettable rent this film you will be glad you did ratings 1/2 out of 4 95 points out of 100 imdb 9 out of 10 note since the story is not new this is as high a rating it can get,1
star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning former new orleans homicide cop jack robideaux jean claude van damme is re-assigned to columbus a small but violent town in mexico to help the police there with their efforts to stop a major heroin smuggling operation into their town the culprits turn out to be ex-military lead by former commander benjamin meyers stephen lord otherwise known as jase from east enders who is using a special method he learned in afghanistan to fight off his opponents but jack has a more personal reason for taking him down that draws the two men into an explosive final showdown where only one will walk away alive after until death van damme appeared to be on a high showing he could make the best straight to video films in the action market while that was a far more drama oriented film with the shepherd he has returned to the high-kicking no brainer action that first made him famous and has sadly produced his worst film since derailed it 's nowhere near as bad as that film but what i said still stands a dull predictable film with very little in the way of any exciting action what little there is mainly consists of some limp fight scenes trying to look cool and trendy with some cheap slo-mo/sped up effects added to them that sadly instead make them look more desperate being a mexican set film director isaac florentine has tried to give the film a robert rodriguez/desperado sort of feel but this only adds to the desperation vd gives a particularly uninspired performance and given he 's never been a robert de niro sort of actor that ca n't be good as the villain lord should n't expect to leave the beeb anytime soon he gets little dialogue at the beginning as he struggles to muster an american accent but gets mysteriously better towards the end all the supporting cast are equally bland and do nothing to raise the films spirits at all this is one shepherd that 's strayed right from the flock,0
i am an atheist with little love for certain aspects of christian fundamentalism that said this movie is reprehensible vile and transparent it only works on the level of the currently fashionable and tired hatred motif of white american christian fundamentalism had this movie been made about a fundamentalist jewish or muslim family or even a black christian family the outrage would have been palpable and the movie would have been roundly panned in all circles as it stands though it 's `` ok '' and `` artful '' because white christian fundamentalists remain one of the last `` acceptable '' targets for garbage such as this and garbage it truly is if you want to see a quality film of a similar bent find and watch or review `` badlands '' nothing good was done in `` the king '' that was n't done better decades ago in that masterful film as other reviewers note the characters are almost completely undeveloped in `` the king '' the lines are a snooze the cinematography is lackluster we 've seen the tale of the sociopath done better 100 times this movie does n't cut it for thoughtful viewers,0
some teen agers go to an old deserted farm house left to one of them by their dead grandfather unaware that there had been several murders there decades earlier because their grandfather had made a pact with the devil for a good harvest- could n't the guy have thought of something better to sell his soul for the man 's grandson and his friends are set up to be the next sacrifice for reasons which are never explained the stereotypical teenage son and his girlfriend the black guy with a white girlfriend and the two lesbians have to do battle with three killer scarecrows- but do n't be tricked like i was this is n't nearly as fun as it sounds it 's mostly just a lot of chit chat about ball kicking dope smoking and the lead actor complaining about never knowing his parents the camera work is atrocious and shaky maybe done on a hand held camcorder in some scenes which maybe a good thing since the scarecrows look like they just came from some kid 's birthday party and apparently they could only hire two people to play the three scarecrows some of the best movies i 've seen have been these low budget independent horror movies but this one is just pathetic the cast and crew seems to have just been made up of a bunch of people who knew each other had never acted before and had no intention of acting again and had a few thousand dollars i ca n't believe this movie cost 130.000 to make and a weekend of free time on their hands- even the lesbian skinny dipping scene is lame i think it 's amusing also that as of this writing there is a sequel to this film which no one has even bothered adding to imdb out of and i only rate it that highly only because of the skinny dipping scene no matter how lame it may be,0
tediously long dreary cinematic waffle i could n't believe how bad this film was i watched it merely because of the numerous people who gushed about it on this site was i watching the same film the entire episode is one-dimensional nothing that happened in garps past affected his or anyone else 's future and no-one was affected by their past i think it was socrates who said about plays that if a scene can be removed from a play without having any effect then it should n't be there obviously the director did n't know this rule and so stuffed his 'work with one dire scene after another even the plane crashing into the house was unexpected it was n't a surprise but it was unexpected it is worth mentioning that at the time of writing this 1st dec 2002 even though many people say it is one of their favourite films no one has bothered to add a memorable quote the reason being that there simply are n't any do n't waste your time watching this watch a plank warp instead,0
`` in 1927 a young man alone in a single engine aeroplane flew non-stop from roosevelt field in new york across the entire north atlantic ocean to le bourget field in paris a distance of three thousand six hundred and ten miles in this triumph of mind body and spirit charles a. lindbergh influenced the lives of everyone on earth -- for in the 33 hours and thirty minutes of his flight the air age became a reality this is the story of that flight '' billy wilder adapts from charles a. lindbergh 's pulitzer prize winning novel of the same name in what is re-creation of lindbergh 's historical 1927 solo flight boosted by a considerably strong lead performance from james stewart himself a pilot as lindberg and containing an intelligent screenplay from wilder and wendell mayes spirit of st. louis is a sincerely well told story in what at times threatens to become a monotonous film wilder keeps it ticking over by using flashbacks to lindbergh 's life after the nicely told build up to the event such as the peril being realised as nungesser and coli go missing never to be found whilst attempting the same trip in reverse we learn stuff like how he come to buy his first plane and his work with the flying circus this is all relative to understanding the man and his obvious passion for flying this also helps to give us a complete picture of lindbergh thus putting us with him in his isolated cockpit as he undertakes this dangerous journey battling isolation his only company is a fly and chronic tiredness it 's here where stewart perfectly portrays lindbergh 's devotion to the task aided by a terrific score from franz waxman and academy award nominated effects by louis lichtenfield wilder 's movie turns out to be an engaging human interest story that got a thoroughly professional production 7/10,1
possibly the worst film within the genre in existence it was announced as a comedy but is simply tragically pathetic i do n't think anyone could have achieved anything more terrible and irritating if they were specifically requested to it is toilet humour at its very poorest i would avoid even watching the trailer i only went to see it because it was announced that if you like monty python you are bound to love this whoever wrote that was either biased or seriously deranged i am still bewildered how one can honestly believe such a statement rarely do i leave the cinema really it takes a lot of effort for a film to have that effect on me this one did it in just 30 minutes,0
in kpax softley brushes on the subtleties of eastern religious mores from the small archetypes embedded all over the film to the actual purpose of prot spacey prot assumes a predominantly didactic role throughout the entire film it is as if the statements he makes embody general truths about a culture of peace which is strongly promulgated in buddhism and hinduism it can be said that prot is the eye of the storm the world is in disarray and is 'bright and the false veil of reality is what everyone else sees but prot sees truth he sees the minute and appreciates it and at some points fears it as he transcends his social construction of reality and becomes more humanly the film is particularly detailed therefore i would recommend that you watch it at least twice to see how softley interjects nuances listen carefully to the narratives at the beginning and end as they truly touch on concepts not commonly presented in western philosophies 9 of out 10 rating superb with nominal room for improvement,1
the warmest most engaging movie of its genre those lips those eyes made me smile and cry as it reminded me of the work it takes to pursue a dream and the pain of disappointment hulce and langella are superb and the story seems to write itself a brilliant screenplay by david shaber one of my favorites see the warriors and nighthawks for more ... and beautiful sets filmed on location i think at the actual summer theater in which the story takes place you ca n't see this movie and not want to drop everything and get into the theater please check this video out if you can find it,1
an stunning look at the ocean and the life in it the good the camera work was absolutely phenomenal every shot is done beautifully it was interesting seeing all the different animals that i could have never even imagined david attenborough has the perfect narrator 's voice no one could have done any better the bad there were one or two different times where there was a reference to the earth being 1 million years old i hold a different belief overall a tv series anyone can enjoy i highly recommend buying it 10/10 stars,1
there are no flaws in this production perfectly entertaining fun and worthy of respect this is what theatre is all about definitely not for the very young but slightly older kids will get a great kick out of seeing it and can be introduced to theatre this way astounding and amazing,1
as with many sequels this one just does n't have the quality or the impact of the original the first one belongs up there with the rest of the greats this one just does n't cut it the first film had a magical `` good time '' feeling about it that is totally missing from this film we became enamored of all these characters minus richard dreyfuss in an age of innocence now a few years later they have changed so much that they are largely different people while this is what happens in real life we do n't expect this to happen to our favorite film characters the film does n't have the humor that the original had and we were expecting to laugh what little humor is there is dark the first film also featured what is probably the greatest soundtrack ever while this one is good but not even close to the original 's this film is so totally different from the original that it is n't even actually a sequel i gave it a 4,0
am i the only person who saw and remembers amadeus every scene in `` copying '' has its counterpart in the milos forman amadeus from the galloping carriages accompanied by frenzied strings to the entrance of anna through the dark hallway preceded by the man with the key to the very dialog of the conclusion with anna at beethoven 's feet a la salieri before the dying mozart does no one else recall the dialog in that script salieri `` time '' mozart `` common time '' ..... '' we begin with the strings ... '' and so it `` copies '' remember cynthia nixon leaning against a door jamb tears falling down her freckled face same scene just replace her with beethoven 's nephew even the scatological humor fart jokes are the same we even have a cardinal followed around by a plate of sweet cookies which recalls salieri in the banquet hall does no one else remember and the scene where anna cries to god `` why did you give me this gift '' ... salieri said the same thing and beyond all that we have a juvenile script with an opening exposition that reads like the character identifications you 'd find in a children 's story `` i am mr. beethoven i am the composer .... '' and what after all is the purpose of the bridge builder other than to juxtapose the technical against the artistic ... a comparison that is not at all developed probably because it has no meaning especially when it comes to beethove who was a master of the technical there 's only one great scene the playing of the ninth first the music which of itself takes you to tears but then there is the highly erotic interaction of anna the copyist keeping time and beethoven conducting which surpasses the most explicit sexual intimacy so intense it 's almost embarrassing but please the rest of the film where is the world 's collective memory you have seen this all before .... and better,0
ever since i first played it in 1998 goldeneye has been one of my favourite video games in fact i recently bought an n64 purely so that i could own it and play it more often the game is pretty much near-perfect the single-player mode does a fantastic job of immersing yourself in bond 's shoes with varied mission objectives convincing weapons and great level design even though the enemies artificial intelligence is pretty basic by today 's standards that only adds to goldeneye 's appeal the method of obtaining cheats completing levels within a strict time limit was also innovative when the title was released and even now i still have n't cracked some of them the game comes with a wonderful multiplayer mode for up to four players and while this is n't as advanced as the combat simulator in the game 's sequel `` perfect dark '' it is still incredibly satisfying to blast your opponents to smithereens with a barrage of rc-p90 fire,1
this movie is a great film the movie shows so many themes all in one amazing film driving lessons centers around ben rupert grint a shy 17 year old who is coming of age the movie goes on about how ben is sick of his dominating mother and how he just wants to be himself ben then meets evie who he makes a very special bond with the two take a journey and in the process ben finds himself and what a relationship that he and evie share this is the movie that you watch by yourself or with someone else no matter what you will all feel what ben goes through in the movie it is a very heart warming film that just makes you think whether your driving lessons were ever as emotional or as much of a journey as ben 's lessons,1
ring ring have-been horror directors hotline how may we help you um yeah pronto i mean hello my name is rugge err call me by my initials r.d okay mr. r.d what seems to be the problem well the reviews on my latest movie `` dial help '' were all negative and harsh and frankly i myself feel like my career has seen better days as well okay mr. r.d and why do you suppose that is well i gained fame and a well-deserved cult status thanks to my controversial and shocking movie about savage tribes of cannibals devouring a film crew and another one about relentless thugs terrorizing wealthy people in a house at the edge of the park for which i borrowed the idea from wes craven but `` dial help '' revolves on err never mind no no mr. r.d go ahead and tell me what the film is about um it 's about a spiritually possessed phone line stalking a sexy model and killing the people surrounding her ah i see that premise does indeed sound a little silly and not as petrifying as cannibals or rapists but i suppose there are deeper themes in your film right oh yeah sure um what do you mean by that well is n't the phone line symbolism for another kind of terror or perhaps it 's all just happening in the mind of your female heroine um nope it 's just about a phone going berserk and murdering people with the cord vibrations electricity or even ordinary coins interesting mr. r.d but how do you explain all this supernatural stuff to the viewer at the end of the movie you see i figured the slowly unraveling phone-mystery plot would n't be that important or relevant so i just concentrated on processing all possible phone-gimmicks i could think of phone gimmicks what do you mean you know like wind blowing through the horn mind-penetrating dial tones and turn-tables catapulting into the air very original mr. r.d but not exactly horrific and as an experienced director you must know that in the end people expect a reasonable clarification of all these events oh but there is it all has to do with negative and unreleased energy if i remember correctly it 's all a bit fuzzy i admit hmm i see oh well as they always say a good motion picture relies on more elements than just the story did you at least process some of your regular trademarks into the film so that your fans at least recognize your style i tried lord knows i tried but the murders and bloodshed are simply not shocking anyone that 's a pity indeed mr. r.d but what about sex everyone likes a good portion of sleaze and nudity in their horror films and you said yourself the film centered on a sexy fashion model in peril yes but but what mr. r.d well to tell you the truth we kind of promoted `` dial help '' as an erotic thriller with revealing shots of charlotte lewis on the cover but in reality there 's no sex in the film and charlotte even refused to go topless mr. r.d now i 'm really disappointed that 's just shamelessly ripping people off and lure them with false promises i know i know and i 'm ashamed but i just wanted everybody to rent `` dial help '' and love it well to round up i can comfort you by saying that every major director is entitled to a few erroneous decisions without it affecting his/her career immediately but be more cautious next time and do some research first okay mr. r.d i will thank you you 're welcome tell me have you got any ideas for upcoming movies already yeah as a matter a fact i do i was thinking about making a giallo with a murderous washing machine does n't that sound fascinating hello hello,0
i watched this movie or part of it in hope that it would be fun to laugh at how bad it was but it soon became clear that this was just plain silly for one you have the worst acting ever the lead `` actress '' birgitte nielsen is terrible uninspired and hardly even attractive and she certainly do not look like the female warrior who could easily kick some veteran warrior kings butt but she does and whats with the feminist attitude it 's plain hypocrisy for one her family was killed by a women then she joins some warrior school or something so she can learn how to fight men she then joins up with a fat servant and his child king whose city was destroyed by gedren those two characters are just plain stupid and destroys the little of atmosphere that the movie managed to create after this i could not take any more of nielsen painful acting and the stupid clichés and lack of some real action schwarzenegger as kalidor was the only part of this movie which actually made it remotely watchable i liked the conan movie but this is pure crap,0
warning i advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment when i first started to watch this movie my expectations were it was a vampire movie that is going to be awesome considering how rodriguez and tarantino both helped make the film i began about 15 minutes into it and already my hopes for this movie were down the drain which shocked me first the story it was going with was not at all appealing in anyway possible and just flat out boring and uncompelling to the point where i just wanted to turn it off i was getting more frustrated with this movie as it dragged on but i guess i had hopes that it would get better .... then when it finally showed vampires it blew my mind in a very bad way i thought '' okay this movie started with some backwash horrible story about these two criminals then very slowly turned into some vampire movie which i thought it was going to be from the beginning in like the last 30 minutes '' to add on to that they try to make the main characters all cool and awesome and mean around the end when they 're just not a bunny would 've been more intimidating than these characters this movie is a horrible piece of crap from dusk till dawn disgraced me and left a terrible taste in my mouth disheartening thoughts in my head and left my body unable to move from the horrible shock that i just wasted 108 minutes of my life away on a horrendous film i do not understand how george clooney quentin tarintino cheech marin and danny trejo all being the good and honorable actors that they are could take part in this useless filth in my opinion from dusk till dawn is one of the worst movies ever made that i have suffered my eyes on do not see it you 'll be doing yourelf a great favor ...,0
`` death bed the bed that eats '' is a supremely bizarre horror film that truly has to be seen to be believed.there is an ancient four-poster bed that just loves to eat humans and it does so anytime it can lure anyone to lie upon it.there is also a long-dead artist imprisoned behind one of his paintings who provides a voice-over narration.george barry 's the first and only one film offers some truly surreal moments such as the bed absorbing its victims in a mysterious sea of yellow foam and liquid.the atmosphere is dreamy and there is only a little bit of gore unfortunately the premise is rather silly and the acting is amateurish.still as fan of unusual cinema i enjoyed this low-budget oddity.give it a chance.8 out of 10,1
inspired by true events radio is one of the best acted heart felt dramas i seen widely released in sometime it definitely is one of the year 's best films of 2003. radio stars ed harris who is oscar worthy nonetheless in this film as football coach harold jones coach jones has been teaching football all his life and loves the game however coach jones does not spend much time with his wife and daughter played by debra winger and sarah drew one day radio played by cuba gooding jr. in his best performance since men of honor comes by the football field while the coach 's team is practicing for the game some members of the team then tie up radio and throw him into a building they then bang on the building and finally coach jones suspects something is wrong he comes over and helps radio who is frightened and from that point on coach jones and radio shares a very special bond radio becomes the highlight of every football game and really enjoys participating in the football games and at school events he also becomes coach jones 's main interest in life over football which at first was his main priority before both his family and radio the movie deals with all sorts of real life problems including what your priorities are life accepting people for who they are even if they are different death and family relationships the movie touches upon all those issues and more and is extremely well done and director michael tollin should be very proud of this film the thing i liked most about radio was how real it felt the performances were like watching something in real life occur right before your eyes radio had a great mix of comedy and drama some parts were quite funny yet other parts were very serious and sad in conclusion i feel that radio was very overlooked by critics only getting average reviews they must have there heads up there butts because its amazing how this film can only get 2 star reviews and something like school of rock can get 3 or 4 stars it does n't make any sense to me also the performances as i mentioned before are top-notch and oscar worthy in my opinion both ed harris who i think is underrated as an actor and cuba gooding jr. should both get some kind on nomination for this movie radio is one my favorite movies of the year and gives me reason to still see some of the big hollywood movies my final rating for radio is a 9/10,1
i just recently viewed shame which is directed by ingmar bergman the film was interesting and very unique i liked how it was in swedish with english subtitles and that it was also in black and white these features allowed me to better relate to the characters the time period and their stories i did n't like how the movie was very slow in the beginning and how you did n't know what was really going on at first it was mainly a story of eva and jan 's relationship the movie also ended on a very depressing note because nothing good came out of all of the conflicts and changes throughout the movie i probably would not go see shame again but it was a very cultured experience,0
having avoided seeing the movie in the cinema but buying the dvd for my wife for xmas i had to watch it i did not expect much which usually means i get more than i bargained for but 'mamma mia utter utter cr i like abba i like the songs i have the old lps but this film is just terrible the stage show looks like a bit of a musical but this races along with songs hurriedly following one another no characterisation the dance numbers which were heavily choreographed according to the extras on the dvd are just thrown away with only half the bodies ever on screen the dance chorus of north europeans appear on a small greek island at will while the set and set up of numbers would have disgraced cliff richard 's musicals in the sixties meryl see me i 'm acting streep ca n't even make her usual mugging effective in an over-the-top musical her grand piece 'the winner takes it all is meryl at the met note to director it should have been shot in stillness with the camera gradually showing distance growing between streep and brosnan some of the singing is awful karaoke on amateur night the camera can not stop moving like bad mtv one can never settle down and just enjoy the music enthusiasm and characters but what is even worse is how this botched piece of excre has become the highest grossing film in the uk and the best selling dvd to boot blair campbell and new labour really have reduced the uk to zombies critical faculties anyone,0
this film is so 1980 's and that is what i like so much about it it does an excellent job of conveying the feel of that odd decade the reality that russian nukes could wipe you out at any time reagan in the white house telling everybody that things were great while more and more social programs were slashed young people dropped out but not as far as their parents of the 1960 's did young people still went to school they just smoked so much dope that their sensetivities were all but dead nothing effected them not even the death of one of their classmates at the hands of one of their friends how weird is it to realize that the murder was wrong but you are not sure why watching the characters deal with the crime is fascinating and telling of a very sick society glover is great keanu is great hopper is incredible one of the most memorable movies i have ever seen,1
as a young lass beautiful joan woodbury as rita adams was orphaned after her `` stool pigeon '' father was shot to death as a young woman ms. woodbury finds herself struggling to keep a job as her murdered father 's ex-convict status makes woodbury a bad business risk woodbury rooms with understanding songstress linda ware as donna andrews who advises woodbury to get in touch with old orphanage friends john archer as bob elliott and jack la rue as mickey roman but none of her friends can help when woodbury is the victim of a scam which lands her in prison upon release woodbury decides to give the male mobsters a run for their money re-titled `` gangs inc. '' this is an obviously weak cheap mobster melodrama still it 's a lot of fun to watch woodbury work wonders with inferior material she plays the innocent growing more sophisticated `` rita '' quite convincingly and she tosses in a great bit as a blonde hooker woodbury must be added to the list of unfortunately underutilized hollywood actresses of the past `` paper bullets '' also features an early alan ladd as jimmy kelly aka bill dugan ms. ware who sang the hit `` an apple for the teacher '' with bing crosby sings a couple of fair '40s numbers nicely but mainly it 's woodbury 's show paper bullets 1941 phil rosen joan woodbury linda ware alan ladd,0
how poor is this movie well i got it less than two months ago and can hardly remember what it was about ... i also paid a £1 for this on dvd the old story of 'put-a-new-cover-on-the-box-and-some-fool-will-buy-it syndrome all i really recall it that the cast ran around a lot use of cars must have been too above the budget and that a vampire was involved then again guess you could know that from the film 's title straight to video rubbish or straight to cheap-jack dvd as it is now this stuff will be in the bargain bins at rental shops supermarkets and charity shops until the death of the sun only cockroaches will rule the earth but this trash will still be around god bless the dawn of the dvd age ....,0
was it really necessary to include embarrassing footage of non-participants in a documentary and why all the silly dog scenes and then repetition of all the same silly dog scenes this film starts with a great promise to expose the international politics and the business of wine it got off to a great start and included all the right characters but the production is a mess points started and developed most of the way then never finished or left with dangling ends very poor and disorienting camera work and editing they should have used subtitles for the british mumbler from christie 's too much fluff and not enough fact for a documentary probably honored at cannes because of the us bashing although in my opinion there was too little of it we left at the 2:00 hour mark i have no idea how much longer it ran on,0
"i 've read some grumbles about the court scenes these people betray their ignorance this production went to simply amazing lengths to recreate all aspects of the period in which the story occurred courtly manners are something few people outside the court ever see while the acting may appear highly stylized it is in fact as close a replication as possible of the behavior of individuals in their particular stations as the director could create the actor 's facial expressions are a marvel particularly the duplicitous marquis changxin and the king 's mother there are of course reflections of both greek and shakespearian tragedy in the relationship between the king his parents and his love the juxtaposition of the king transforming from good to bad and the assassin from bad to good provides much food for thought on the evolution of an individual 's nature this movie would provide much to ponder in a college course on the humanities at the same time it almost rushes along even in the slowest scenes heading towards an inexorable denouement one suspects the involvement of large portions of the troop movements which were quite awesome it makes the lord of the rings battle scenes pale by comparison few directors have the ability to literally field thousands of humans on the field of battle just for art 's sake i recall one scene in which at least 30,000 troops can be seen moving across a huge plain the logistics for such a shot would have been staggering i could go on ... but simply i ca n't recommend this film highly enough",1
when i was 8 years old and going through my marx brothers phase my father read in the tv guide that they were showing the marx brothers film `` the big store '' late on friday night and set the vcr to tape it for me when i woke up on saturday -- due no doubt to a misprint in the tv guide -- my father and i discovered `` the story of mankind '' had been recorded instead `` the big store '' was probably one of the least funny of all the marx brothers movies and nevertheless it stands as one of the century 's finest works of cinema when compared with `` the story of mankind '' i can almost justify tv guide 's error in that the marx brothers -- groucho chico and harpo -- appear in both movies although in `` the story of mankind '' they are divided up into a series of unrelated scenes groucho plays peter minuit chico plays some guy talking to christopher columbus and harpo plays isaac newton harpo 's scene lasts about half a minute chico only has two or three lines groucho 's scene is at least funny but horribly racially insensitive by today 's standards the rest of the movie does n't bear mentioning they trotted out some of the finest actors of the day and made them recite total garbage what a disappointment tv guide i sent you a nice letter i 'm still waiting for an apology for the record `` the big store '' has a wonderful bit of physical comedy with the marx brothers on roller skates and a couple of songs by virginia o'brien i was really looking forward to seeing it,0
eh oui impossible n'est pas gaulois well paced highly entertaining film pretty good command of the french language and knowledge of modern france and history are recommended i do n't think this film really works in any other language the film is incredibly much better than the previous one in search of ... apart from great actors and savvy camera handling it 's the wit and firework of allusions word plays etc that make for a really great movie the cartoon vorlage is recognizable but the film is very emancipated the cost of the film is put to good use indeed all the special effects fit 'naturally into the movie you never feel choked by them bref oui les 2cvs ça traîne un peu mais à part cela imhotep -a neighbour from the other side of the rhine,1
the screenplay is the worst part of this film as it lurches from one premise to the next missing all the important bits that would have made a number of different stories possible this film is confusing because the audience does n't know what the story is i had no problem with the low-production values and the acting was n't great but this is telly so it was fine i do n't mind if some scenes looked like they were done in one take but having such a non-sensical screenplay is completely unnecessary did any executive actually read it before forking out the cash avoid this at all costs the prologue in particular was so poorly written it needed a voice-over to fill in all the details that had been left out the prologue was rushed it was n't clear what was happening ie the russian revolution was reduced to `` some riots are happening in petersburg '' with the next scene being soldiers arresting them i know the basic history of the revolution so i could fill in the details `` those pesky communists '' the prologue is best ignored this could have been a thoughtful study of a person who is confused about who she is it sets up this premise in the asylum it could then have her struggling to identify herself for the rest of the film no gone the film assumes she is who she says she is even though there is still no empirical evidence it sets up a melodramatic romance a love so strong it 'll believe anything she says okay a soppy romance no because it makes no sense the love interest seems like a crazed and incidentally sleazy lunatic bursting out in wild gestures this also does n't work because the film stupidly decides to tell the truth in the monologue at the end they never got married and she returned to america the love story collapses despite there being plenty of love scenes i was never convinced of the reason that they were in love i find rom-com romances more convincing despite there only being one or two scenes which establish that they 've even spent any time with each other it could have been a thriller-type thing where the film assumes she is who she says she is and she struggles to prove her identity no the court case is summed up rather than dealt with the bizarre voice over comes back again to fill in the details of a better film the funniest thing to consider is what really happened anna anderson was a loony who went to america and married another loony and they did crazy things together throughout her life she had bouts of lunatic behaviour none of this in the film either there 's a really annoying character in the asylum who crops up from nowhere and announces herself as a 'one flew over the cuckoo 's next/'twelve monkeys'-type informant thankfully she vanishes having brought nothing to the story,0
this low budget crocodile movie really delivers the goods the fact that it was inspired by true events would mean little if you wound up with a fake looking crocodile bad c.g.i. or an obvious studio setting fortunately none of the above are involved with this terrific very realistic film the crocodile is real there is no c.g.i. and the on location filming takes place in an actual australian swamp the actors were obviously inspired to create as much realism as possible in their performances and they succeed you can place yourself in their predicament which is testament to how realistically `` black water '' translates as entertainment highly recommended merk,1
the best thing about shrieker is the dialogue like scream and i know what you did last summer this movie is cognizant of the conventions of this type of horror movie and manages to come up with a few good lines and scenes that play on those conventions unfortunately shrieker is just boring the plot is your basic ten little indians whodunnit with a monster controlled by one of the suspects/victims you know from the beginning that each of the characters will get bumped off until only the hero ine is left to defeat the evil and this is exactly what happens absolutely no surprises and no tension production values and acting were ok but i had no motivation to watch to the end although i did because i already knew how the end scene would play out the ending did surprise me a bit because it managed to fizzle out literally instead of throwing out a bucket of special effects maybe the special effects budget had been spent up by the end,0
korine 's established himself by now as a talented and impressive image-maker the promotional posters for mister lonely all include the film 's most impressive compositions though there 's one in particular i 've yet to see in promo material that of a blue-clad nun teasing a dog with a stick surrounded by green forest with torrential rain pouring down the opening images of this film of michael jackson lookalike diego luna riding a small motorbike round a track is strangely compelling and beautiful roy orbison 's `` mister lonely '' plays on the soundtrack and the images unfold in slow-motion there 's also a funny and terrific sequence in which the same character mimes a dance without music though a radio sits like a silent dog next to him in the middle of a paris street korine splices in sound effects and jump-cuts that evoke both a feeling of futility and dogged liberation in the character 's dance routine the first instance of the segment dealing with the nuns is also strangely poignant father umbrillo werner herzog is an autocratic priest about to fly with some nuns over and drop food into impoverished areas nearby in a scene that is both light-hearted and affecting herzog must deal with a stubbornly enthusiastic local who wishes to make the plane trip with them in order to see his wife in san francisco as the exchange develops herzog draws out of the man a confession he has sinned and his frequent infidelity is the cause of his wife having left him in the first place this scene short and sweet gains particular weight after one learns its improvised origins the sinner is played by a non-actor who was on set when korine and co. were filming and his adulterous ways had given him in real life a lasting overwhelming guilt henceforth the film is hit-and-miss a succession of intrinsically interesting moments that add to a frivolous muddled narrative whereas gummo and julien donkey-boy maintain their aesthetic and emotional weight via coherent structural frameworks mister lonely feels like a victim of editing room ruthlessness a few scenes were cut from the film which would have otherwise painted fuller pictures of certain characters due to continuity errors in costume a result no doubt due to the absence of a shooting script and korine 's tendency for improvisation one deleted scene in particular in which 'charlie chaplin denis lavant and 'madonna melita morgan have sex would have added much more emotional conflict to a scene later on in the film i wo n't spoil it but it 's there to deflate any feeling of warmth or celebration and as it is only half-succeeds the two strands of the narrative unconnected literally are best approached as two entirely different stories with the same allegorical meaning one compliments the other and vice versa it 's something to do with the conflict between one 's ambitions and the reality of the current situation but there 's not enough of the herzog scenes to merit their place in the film and so any connection between these two allegorically-connected threads is inevitably strained and the inclusion is in retrospect tedious this is an ambitious step forward from julien donkey-boy that suffers mostly at least in the lookalike segments from having far too many characters for the film 's running length a flaw that would have been even worse had big star names played everyone as was originally planned with many of the imagery 's self-contained beauty and moments of real genuine connection with the soundtrack this feels like it 'd be much more suited to an art installation or photo exhibition as an exploration of mimesis and the nature of impersonation it 'd lose none of its power indeed for me it would perhaps be more impressive the loneliness attached to iconic performativity such as that encountered by both the icons themselves and those who aspire to be like them is well-captured in images such as that wherein 'marilyn monroe a gorgeous samantha morton seduces the camera with a seven year itch pose in the middle of a forest or when 'sammy davis jr. jason pennycooke settles post-dance rehearsal with his back to the camera overlooking an incredible tranquil lake as it is moments like these and all those where the titles of randomly-chosen michael jackson songs crawl across the scene are married to one another in a film narrative far less affecting than it should be for those who see it i lost all faith during the egg-singing scene late on you 'll know which scene i mean because it sticks out like a sore thumb as some sort of gimmicky attempt at the new cinematic language for which korine has previously been hailed,0
my college theater just had a special screening last night of this film i have got to say that i think everyone was impressed with how good this movie was though my roommate did n't care for it but he 's not into horror movies anyway and just went to see if paris hilton can act by the way if you 're worried about that do n't be i 'm not exactly one of her fans but i must be honest and say she was pretty good and she has the best death scene overall all the actor 's were very good i 'm not gon na go into detail for the plot since i 'm sure you know about it surpirsisngly the characters are pretty engaging and you actually care for them especially elisha cuthbert and chad michael murray 's characters we meet them as rival siblings and end with them having to work together another plus is that it does not have the sleek look of amityville horror or texas chainsaw massacre and feels almost documentary-like rather than a music video do n't get me wrong i loved texas chainsaw and enjoyed amityville now for the death scenes in most slasher movies whenever a character is stabbed or killed the scene immediately cuts away to another scene but not in this one when a character is about to die they die pretty gruesomely but the filmmakers do n't stop there and add a little something extra each time for each victim i wo n't say anything about the death scenes and will let you see them for yourself while this is a great slasher movies it does have the flaws of almost all slasher films exploring a creepy house when you should n't be getting a ride with a suspicious character splitting up and screaming so the killer can hear you also there is a kinda stupid plot twist that was unnecessary and did n't add to the film at all you could tell it was just added in at the last moment and if you took it out it would not have affected the movie at all basically if you are a horror film fan see this movie you will not be disappointed it 's got all that 's needed to make it a great slasher film possibly the best of the year even though it 's kinda early the suspense is felt and it is at times a funny movie if you hate horror films chances are you may like this one and if you are divided i encourage you to give it a shot,1
the premise of bottom crossed with fawlty towers sounds great however ade edmonson rik mayall have managed to create a film that raises barely a titter ten years ago rik mayall 's mad stare and ade 's idiocy were funny now they are just annoying the film had promise though the most horrendous hotel in britain is not a new idea but failed to deliver the saving graces were competent performances from simon spaced big train pegg and helene mathieu and the film is only 90 minutes long sorry guys but you really have hit the bottom,0
rarely have i seen a work of literature translated so badly to the screen the hysterical cast of b-movie and sitcom extras simply make the characters seem like bad jewish stereotypes the worst of all is melissa gilbert who you hate from scene one and never develop any sympathy for performances like this should be noted and used against actors who wish to work again all in all a seedy low-budget made-for-tv film of the sort that gives made-for-tv films a bad name,0
this movie had potential if it had been handled differently what it needed was a different director that 's certain and perhaps a different leading lady i just ca n't understand the minnie driver character or at least how she played it she was completely unbelievable i can not believe she would have liked her performance in this movie either she was probably abandoned by the director or incapable of delivering what the director was trying to get her to do i am writing this as i am still watching it i 'm thinking i would have hated to be in her shoes trying to 'act something i did n't understand well we 've just proceeded to the affair she begins with the son i 'm still watching i 'm now beginning to be profoundly embarrassed for everyone involved in this enterprise if you enjoy watching movies that miss their mark in a big way then watch this one,0
this movie is about carlos `` the jackal '' quinn an international terrorist who by cia agent henry fields 's sutherland description appears to maim women and children for the heck of it at least that 's what he says to guilt us naval officer annibal ramirez quinn again into taking on the assignment of posing as carlos and setting him up as a traitor in the eyes of the kgb ramirez is apparently physically identical to carlos but mentally he is his antithesis he is borne of order and carlos is borne of chaos the movie is n't all shoot-gun-jump-around action and that 's a good thing in its first half ramirez undergoes training to act and think like carlos and that 's actually where the movie achieves its distinction from other run-of-the-mill action flicks an israeli agent kingsley joins fields in training ramirez and together they appear to take on the roles of parents in the birthing of ramirez 's new character ramirez is taught to dislike the things carlos dislikes to act on the split second like carlos would and even to make love like carlos courtesy of an ex-girlfriend of carlos 's naturally all that he is taught would be put to good use in the later half of the movie it 's a little contrived but quinn gives a riveting performance as a carlos-wannabe another thing i liked about this movie was that it did n't utilize the much overdone plot point in evil twin movies you know the one in which the evil twin insinuates himself into the good twin 's family ramirez 's family does come into the picture but instead they highlight how his new character wrecks havoc on his family life good chuckle humor is injected into this movie often coming the acerbic duo of sutherland and kingsley an exception is the overused and apparently gratuitous joke involving ramirez 's first name annibal annabelle get it also overdone was the constant harping by the duo about how powerful and cunning and intelligent carlos is in my opinion during the final showdown the payoff was n't able to match the build-up on the whole the movie was enjoyable i 'm not a big action flick fan but this movie was more intelligent and engrossing than the average action movie and it maintained my attention throughout my rating 9/10,1
this movie is a shame especially considering andrzej wajda is not an amateur but professional director however this movie fails to deliver anything you could expect first of all -- i am polish so i can tell all the background story because i read books but how can you tell there is even a war from this movie -- bunch of people are going back and forth some soldiers are shouting ... this is really the second world war or soldiers are on vacations acting and dialogs -- poor miserably poor a.żmijewski d.stenka m.komorowska w.kowalski a.chyra fit in their roles the rest of polish cast is out of the place most notably m.ostaszewska one of the leading characters what an unfortunate choice 99 of the dialogs are not spoken they are just put there actors had difficulties to perform and it is no surprise considering what odd things they had to say and this leads us to the most disappointing issue -- you ca n't feel it everything is so theatrical artificial there is no real life there is no feeling in it there are a lot of original footage from the wwii and guess what the material is much more powerful dramatic than what a.wajda did i can see only one positive -- despite historical mistakes like acronym zsrr it was made for post-1945 propaganda purposes to please polish that zsrs was gone and now there was zsrr but in 1940 there was no zsrr luckily it is undoubtedly shown killing in katyn was done by soviets yes it is a fact not some controversial gossip great two hours for 5-10 minutes scene anyway -- time and potential wasted this is tragedy of epic proportions will to fight in 1939 barely shown not declaring war against soviet union by polish authorities sic not shown here imprisonment of soldiers shortly after living in the outrageous conditions not shown here hope and fear what will come next barely shown and then ... extermination hand to hand with germans -- soviets were exterminating polish nation aimed at people who constituted the backbone of poland unfortunately they succeed and the results are still visible to this very day,0
i 've read many unflattering comments regarding this film and the only things i have seen that they all have in common are `` boring '' and `` unrealistic '' first of all they used real frickin crocs how much more realistic can you get no cgi no animatronics no miniatures just a croc and a piece of meat have fun fellas there is no question that this film gets off to a slow start character development what little they had anyway does take a bit of time and i think this is primarily where this film lacks however when the film gets going i found the action picked up dramatically i do n't mean to say that there is a lot of action if anything there are more moments where the croc ca n't be seen at all and the people are just waiting however we know that there is n't going to be any relief and that the croc is just biding its time this had a similar eerie feel to other films that achieve their horror through non-action such as open water another film that has been criticized by some viewers as being `` boring '' personally i think that viewers who find themselves incapable of feeling the suspense have had their attention spans surgically removed at birth but that 's just me finally the characters feel real and the situation is such that it really could happen to anyone in the right circumstances furthermore the deaths are completely real and at times it 's a little tough to watch all in all this one 's a winner,1
i always liked listening to buddy holly and felt a real loss when he was killed at a young age in an airplane crash he was n't in the old rock 'n roll class of let 's say chuck berry or jerry lee lewis but he was n't far behind who knows how big his legacy would have been had he sang for decades almost every single he put out was a hit so i was very pleasantly surprised how good a job gary busey did at playing him and at imitating his singing voice he did buddy proud as were the actors don stroud and charles martin smith who played holly 's backup group `` the crickets '' music-wise there are some of holly 's better-known songs in the beginning of the film and its really good with a strong finish at the end as holly and the boys are shown in iowa in their last concert ever busey not only sings like holly he 's a dead ringer for him in the looks department some thing was the actor '' s best performance ever and you get no argument from me i 'm also glad they ended the film on an upbeat note with that iowa concert instead of dwelling on his tragic accident the ending could have been a real downer but they did n't let it be,1
if folks were really this stupid i could be the srw supreme ruler of the world in this one knotts plays a dimwitted bean counter for some little jerk water town run by a group of crooked simpletons only slightly brighter than he is when things appear a bit shaky for the crooks they go for a frame-up of the patsy figg plenty of laughs as knotts does his usual bumbling stumbling act i especially appreciated the extension cord scene asininity at it 's highest level,1
do n't get me wrong i love most of paul schrader 's movies so it was with sheer excitement i was able to attend at the `` rolling thunder '' screening at the parisian french cinemathèque with surprise movie on the 17th dec 2004. of course the surprise movie was the exorcist and most people were there for that i was too the film was then finished but the score so p schrader used excerpts from the return of the king and some other movie i forget was it conan anyways apart from that the movie was finalized the happy few there maybe 200 people were told to please not write about the film on the internet or magazines since it may have jeopardized its chance of getting selected to the cannes film festival then came the film then came the realization that the film might not get selected for the festival because of its quality never in my life had i experienced such a feeling of awkwardness in the audience as people went from being skeptical to plainly laughing out loud at the pity-full spectacle i could n't believe how low the author of light sleeper mishima blue collar and affliction had sunk forced over-the-top acting thorough stupid ending black and white moral awful fxs worst take on christianity from schrader ever not even suspenseful just boring as hell no pun intended and unsurprising at all some good locations but sadly miss-used or at least not fulfilling the initial hopes in the end i was 100 times more satisfied by the schrader penned rolling thunder and wished my 2 hours back do n't believe the hype even the john boorman movie is more exciting and original oh and the billy crawford casting the poor guy does his best but what where you expecting he 's now part of the small club of worst casting mistakes ever i give the movie a 1/5 just because i did n't leave the room but i should have,0
i have never seen `` american werewolf in london '' but this movie was very entertaining when renting it i thought it was a horror movie but it turned out to be more of a comedy with some horror aspects i thought the transformation sequences were nicely done but effects wise the best scenes were those where the effects and the lighting built off each other nice the transformations reminded me a lot of werewolf transformations in other movies but the werewolves themselves are very beastly and not very dog like gore i do believe there is too much in this movie which really takes away from the horror when every frame has blood in it taking the violence seriously is hard j.hurst 8th grade,1
the first thing i noticed about this movie was how well everything was set up a quality movie all round i suppose you could love this film just for its action but i liked it for more than that this is a pure thriller/horror movie it offers a more fully-fleshed script than most horror films do i thought at least the u.s. version ended brilliantly and was great throughout the story felt honest and brutal the film has an excellent tight script that keeps the action moving with believable characters in largely believable situations,1
i agree with most of mr. rivera 's comments and i just want to ad a couple of caveats this film `` the mascot '' is criminally neglected in its current form for that matter so is `` vampyr '' `` the mascot '' is n't a `` bonus feature '' -- it 's tacked on as a chapter in `` vampyr '' even though it 's made very clear that this is a separate movie it should have been treated as such by the manufacturers and while i '' m at it `` vampyr '' needs some of that same respect and cleaning up as well i got the feeling the decision to put the mascot on there went something like this dude a `` we just transferred vampyr to dvd but it comes up about 20 minutes short we need to put something on there that wo n't cost much money can you believe film critics want to be paid to talk about films '' dude b `` not to worry i have this little animation thingy that 's been sitting in my drawer just go ahead and throw it on as an additional chapter '' dude a `` you 're awesome dude b '' the animation 's of the mascot is great and there 's no need for me to repeat what mr. rivera 's done so well however this thing needs some major cleaning and restoring especially the audio the plot comes through in the dialogue and in my copy there were so many hisses pops and places where the sound just dropped right off i would have had no idea what the dog was going after without having read the box no amount of volume was going to make the words more understandable it just brought up the tinniness and made the hisses and pops louder bottom line is starewicz 's films need to be put into a respectful collection cleaned up spiffed up liner notes and the whole nine yards in other words they need to be `` criterionized '' 9 out of 10 for the movie not the product which would get only a 5,1
i 'm a fan of good plausible action movies and i 'm a huge fan of the elite military units such as the navy seals finally i 'm a huge fan of michael biehn sadly none of those allowed me to really enjoy this movie at the time i gave it another chance more recently when i bought the dvd here 's the problems with this movie in a quick list 1. it 's a poor mans top gun for example including a virtual music video of the seal team playing golf with a soundtrack of `` the boys are back in town '' which concludes with charlie sheen doing an inane chase to get his towed car back 2. this is quite simply a charlie sheen movie when sheen was trying to be famous before he started doing stuff like hot shots reports i 've heard indicate that sheen was a baby on the set and it affected the roles and direction the rest of the actors in the movie got 3. biehn is the head of the seal team yet sheen seldom obeys him any seal showing the lack of discipline that sheen 's character does or who endangered the team as he does would n't even have made it through buds training let alone gotten on a team 4. seals are cross trained on weapons yet in one part of the movie a seal has to `` figure out '' how to use a u.s. stinger missile there are a few good scenes in the movie the assault entry at the beginning bill paxton as `` god '' and some of the footage in what was supposed to be beirut at the time overall though this movie is a loser,0
i see it when i was 12 year old and i dream to see it again what marvelous sammy davis jr singing `` it ai n't necessarily so '',1
i thought this movie was absolutely hilarious i already knew it was going to be a funny movie but it was funnier than i expected sure there were some lame jokes but they cracked me up i thought the actors were going to turn out to be pretty bad but the actors were good in acting out this comedy i have to give kudos to amanda bynes she looked surprisingly like her brother and pulled off an awesome performance as a boy as for the other actors they were funny as well of course there were moments where you yell at the screen `` how can you not tell `` but that 's all part of the fun in the end the plot turned out pretty well there 's a happy ending but what 'd you expect overall just hilarious,1
developing movies that are based on actual events involving cryptozoology or the supernatural has always been a challenge for directors and screenwriters you have to mainly reconcile reported testimonies conflicting info sources and hollywood creativity to produce something the audience can get into unfortunately for sasquatch none of these things seem to take place the movie starts out in typical film noir when a research team crash lands somewhere in the cascades via airplane from there the research team disappears and despite attempts from law enforcement officials and local rescue parties they remain missing for some time while one of the passengers is walking infra-red-like images are splashed on the screen a la predator which subtly hint that the legendary sasquatch is the cause of the passengers fates cue harlan knowles henriksen ceo of biocomp industries and father of one of the crash victims knowles puts together his own search rescue team with the explicit mission of finding his daughter and the rest of the research crew along with the invaluable technology lost during the crash after knowles tailor-made rescue team is put together the entire movie traverses down the path of uncolorful characters dizzying cinematography and a totally unoriginal plot line i literally had to keep myself from falling asleep during this movie as it attempted to frighten me out of my wits the only member of the cast that held his own was henriksen which does n't make up for the lack of depth presented in all of the other characters the over-done sound effects were annoying as well basically i did n't know if i was watching a movie about bigfoot or grizzly bears neither was the plot line all that great it was too underdeveloped as the viewer is mainly subjected to typical fright music found in anything similar of the genre obviously you did n't have to be a genius to figure out who would be pulling off all their clothes by the middle of the movie or who 'd be the first unlucky soul to get mauled by mr. sasquatch as far as good points there are none and therefore i gave this movie a 2 out of 10,0
a widely unknown strange little western with mindblowing colours probably the same material as it was used in `` johnny guitar '' i guess `` trucolor '' or something which makes blood drips look like shining rubies nearly surrealistic scenes with twisted action and characters something different far from being a masterpiece but there should be paid more attention to this little gem in western encyclopedias,1
all in all do n't expect much and you wo n't be disappointed and if you want to see a movie that will take you back to 1983 this will do that for sure the only reason i gave this movie 2 points more than it deserves is for 2 reasons 1. michael caine 2. the people the sights the culture and the music of brazil the movie is almost completely carried by caine as he commits the seemingly impossible task of transforming it into a viable and semi-believable story even joe bologna and valerie harper fall short michael caine is pure class as always besides being a gifted classical and comic actor caine brings a blend of introspection mischievousness and sensitivity to every movie he does ... the focus of his charm as far back as his role in alfie ... and the reason why he won the academy award for hannah and her sisters 2 years later in this farce he is tenderly beguiling ... funny and vulnerable ... melancholy and sentimental .... and besides the jewel that is rio de janeiro the only reason to not seek out a better form of entertainment well ... maybe a glimpse at the 2 lovely young actresses michelle johnson and demi moore would be a reason but look is all you can do at michelle though her look seems sorely dated .... there could n't be a more painful movie experience than watching her `` try '' to act most of her dialogue seems overdubbed too demi 's acting and looks hold up 100 times better and you could easily transplant her as is into any movie today she does n't really look much different to be honest ms. moore is surely underused especially considering she was the bigger star of the 2. save the fact that it is a silly farce at the end i actually kind of like the maturity with which all these people handle this scandalous situation ... that it does n't end friendships nor marriages and that an affair even with the underage daughter of your best friend could be forgiven and everyone can move on the injured parties do show anger and disappointment at what transpired but all works out for the best .... a bit unrealistic for sure but surprisingly refreshing hope always is,0
i saw this film at a special screening at first i thought the movie would be like a typical amanda bynes movie but i was wrong the movie is based on the shakespeares book `` the twelth night '' this movie tells the story of a girl who lives to play soccer well when the girls team is cut she has to go to great lengths to get on the guys team at a different school to get revenge on the egotistical guys team at her old school on her way she gets caught up in a long tangled web of love lies and deception this movie is this years mean girls i think it shows some great new actors abilities and there are defiantly some big stars to be featured in this movie,1

this movie was probably one of the worst movies i 've seen in a very long time a friend of mine grabbed it off the shelf at the video rental store and all but forced me to watch it an action we both deeply regret ehh ... where to start the writing the acting the quality all of it sucked quite possibly some of the worst writing ever displayed in a movie the dialog was worse than i thought it could ever be in the movies blatant dialog such as `` how ya doing '' ... `` not that great doc '' directly after an attempted exorcism of a man 's daughter and then his wife 's attempted suicide of course he 's not that great was at some points kind of funny if not horribly written planned out and obvious the general plot of the movie the writing and the way it worked horrible it was like the writers could come up with nothing better to do then write a bunch of crappy dialog and throw in as many sex and nudity scenes as they randomly could the only almost good sex scene between the preacher and the tattooed peirced girl was filmed with such poor quality that it looked more like a cheap porno than a feature film oh yeah and they never actually got the deed done the acting horrible x100 i think the only good actor was the short spanish guy who played miguel del zamora and his part was written horribly the worst acting arguably paul kappellas whose acting combined with shitty music a gun and a half naked bluish white girl running around in the woods made the movie almost unbearable to sit through he even screwed up his own death scene one that should have been easy to nail although most everybody else 's acting was horrible as well the lack of characters also added to the overall suck level of the movie there were just enough characters so that almost half of the characters died that same amount of people became possessed at one point and then the remaining characters could n't be counted on one hand like ... 50 thumbs down p.s what is it with the climax of exorcism movies happening in a stable anyways,0
you know this is one of those `` emperor 's new clothes '' films it 's like so off the wall and strange that you 're supposed to like it if you 're really into film well i think that 's a bunch of bologna films like this which hide under the cloak of dada or surrealism make me nuts some person has this bad dream perhaps brought on by eating the aforementioned bologna right before going to bed remembers most of it unfortunately and then puts it on film and we 're all supposed to marvel at their creative genius i have bizarre dreams too sometimes that make absolutely no sense but i do n't feel the need to put them on film expose everybody else to them and call it art weirdness does not in of itself mean something is interesting true dada or surrealistic expression has some intent and intellectual thought behind it if other people do n't get it that does n't make it profound it just makes it incomprehensible bizarreness for bizarreness sake for me is not good let alone great art and comparing `` tuvalu '' to `` delicatesen '' is like comparing `` the godfather i ii '' to `` the godfather iii '' -- -same genre not in the same league,0
my roommate and i have another friend that works at a local blockbuster video he finds truly awful movies for us and tells us about them one of them was a `` christmas horror '' film starring former professional wrestler bill goldberg as a killer satna claus we did n't watch it immediately but we did n't think there could be anything worse apparently we were wrong we were shown this slasher film `` starring '' ken shamrock versus a murderous scarecrow at first we thought ken would actually be the killer scarecrow and that 's why we wanted to watch but he was n't and that made the movie even worse what absolutely ruined the movie was the teen drama if you want to save your brain cells from trying to escape from your head never ever watch this movie,0

i think gerard 's comments on the doc hit the nail on the head interesting film but very long it 's definitely the antithesis to the new school of flashy sexy moore-style docs there is no narrator no facts or side info interlaced and no other gimmicks what you see is what you get a glimpse into the vanishing world of the saltmen of tibet as a huge doc fan i was surprised how much i lost attention with this film namely due to the length and lack of dialogue in the end though i would recommend it if the subject matter sounds interesting to you it 's beautifully shot informative and presents a valuable and closing window into the way of life of the tibetan saltmen and women all important attributes of a good doc but do put on a big pot of coffee it 'll help,1
i must admit when i saw the preview for `` inglorious basterds '' i gave myself big expectations this film did not disappoint rarely when i watch a movie with such high-expectations do i have those expectations met or exceeded this film did that and more even more rarely do i clap at the end of a movie this i and everyone else in the theater did i have to say i am a little biased towards quentin i grew up with `` pulp fiction '' i watched it when i was 12 and it is still my favorite and most influential film however since then quentin has not really lived up to his billing his style was getting a little predictable instead of familiar the quality honestly was n't there i never watched jackie brown and then there 's grindhouse that is until `` inglorious basterds '' what quentin did was exactly what was needed for the war genre a spaghetti western feel that could only be done by tarantino or sergio leone but seeing how leone is dead tarantino 's the self appointed guy on this masterpiece so let 's look at the movie which i wo n't give away the writing was spot on a beautiful transition between using not one but four different languages in this movie not to mention this movie was set up in the classic tarantino mold great scenes of rich meaningful dialog and sudden shocking action the acting was superb christopher waltz deserves an oscar seriously i do n't say that often but honestly the man should get one for this movie he spoke every language in this movie and delivered with such amazing touch and poise he stole the show in a movie that everybody was amazingly impressive i have no problem building this movie up because this movie is the best film i 've seen all year and probably all of next year quite frankly the more i think about it this movie may crack my top films of all time and is quentin 's best movie since `` pulp fiction '' take it from me watch this film i loved it does n't do this movie enough justice i watched it yesterday and i 'm still blown away thank you quentin from the bottom of my heart for you making this movie you 're back on top again buddy i ca n't say enough for `` inglorious basterds '',1
this movie 's script is indistinguishable from others most notably the core another bad movie it 's pretty clear why luke perry does n't get much work but to see the beloved lt. commander worf michael dorn resigned to something like this is just sad i really ca n't think of one plot twist that is n't seen coming a mile away that 's not an exaggeration special effects are very poor even by tv standards the lava flow at the beginning of the movie signaling the coming global disaster starts things off at a very amateurish level and it gets no better from that point on,0
nothing special to see here the animation has being outdated and the plot is a typical futuristic era this film has an original story but if it does n't have an original plot or characters so in my opinion it 's not worth seeing i 'm not saying that the movie was bad it was just a typical anime story and i thought i watched this movie like a thousand times so if you are looking for something original see another thing,0
my god this is funny stuff yes it 's puerile in the extreme but also rather witty `` here 's the page with all the wines on it '' `` it 's a little early for us i 'm afraid '' `` well what are you doing up then '' and the fight sequences are second to none despite what you may have heard the laughs do keep coming and at a surprisingly generous rate the sheer comic abilities of rik mayall and adrian edmondson help keep it riotously funny wringing every drop of comedy from the script i can only compare it to `` fear and loathing in las vegas '' you either find that film hysterical throughout or not at all the same applies here it 's probably the funniest british film since `` withnail and i '' but to say it 's an acquired taste is something of a gross sic understatement,1
this film is a perfect example of great escapism i loved this film and was sucked in from the very beginning sure it 's just an action flick but is n't having fun what watching movies is all about the cast of this film are very strong with likable characters the friendship between the boys is so realistic and appealing it 's heart warming and hilarious to see a group of teenage boys interact especially this group of boys sean astin makes a great rebel successfully avoiding being a precocious teenager if you want fun watch this film i thoroughly enjoyed it even though i was watching it on a very dirty and old vhs that was terrible quality go dvd 's,1
`` plots with a view '' of 2002 is a delightful little comedy like only the british could do it the film 's sense of humor is both mildly morbid and black and yet very lovable and sometimes very slapstick-ish it 's the only film by director nick hurran i 've seen so far and while i am not intending to watch any of his other films at the moment i 'm not a big fan of romantic comedies this one is highly enjoyable and very funny the film takes place in a little town in wales where betty rhys-jones brenda blethyn is married to the town 's drunken and adulterous major robert pugh the local mortician boris alfred molina has been desperately in love with betty since their childhood but has always been too shy to confess his love to her apart from being desperately in love boris has some other problems as the eccentric american mortician frank featherbed christopher walken has opened a funeral flourishing business in the same town ... the film 's odd very british wit should amuse everybody with a sense of humor and the story sometimes becomes quite bizarre also `` plots with a view '' profits from a wonderful cast brenda bethlyn who has already proved herself to be a funny lady in 2000 's `` saving grace '' plays the lead and she is once again very funny and very lovable in her role alfred molina who plays her shy admirer delivers a great performance as always and robert pugh fits perfectly in the role of betty 's sleazy husband beautiful naomi watts is also great as the husband 's 'secretary i 'm becoming a bigger fan with every film i see her in the greatest role however is played by the incomparable christopher walken one of my favorite actors walken is brilliant as he always is in the role of the eccentric mortician who arranges funerals that are quite unorthodox overall `` plots with a view '' is a vastly entertaining little british comedy that i highly recommend,1
i saw this stage show when it was broadcast on pbs in 1983. i was involved in local theatre at the time and had seen some pretty incredible stuff out of the dell arte players but bill irwin floored me i was most impressed at how a man of his size he 's quite tall and beefy could fold himself up into a small box without so much as a pause for adjustment and move across the stage at a dead run without even a whisper of sound from his feet if he chose not to make any noise most amazing for me though in this performance was the way he rose to his feet during the jack-in-the-box / marionette piece those who saw this show will recall that when he climbed from the box and collapsed to the floor with his body limp and limbs akimbo he `` pulled '' himself up by the top of his head as if by a string and rose not just to his feet but to a full ballet pointand did it in one fluid seemingly effortless motion just consider the strength grace balance and focus such a series of movements must take in order to accomplish them the way he did add to his physical prowess his strong and believable characterization skills and there lies a consummate actor / performer my jaw dropped at the movement and my heart broke at the portrayal of a puppet who is determined to be more than just a lifeless thing in a box as to the unfortunate yes '' tragic '' would be a better word unavailability of this piece in home media form i have noticed that much of pbs works are not available on tape or dvd sometimes pbs shows will be available for direct purchase from them for a limited time immediately following a broadcast but they seldom stay on the market for long there are exceptions of course but these are mainly the science and history documentaries rarely does an arts piece remain in print for longassuming it ever made it into vhs / dvd to begin with i do n't know why this should be so certainly pbs could use the income from home media marketing of their shows but they do n't take advantage of it much this is a shame there are many things i 've watched on pbs that i wish to own but pieces such as `` the regard of flight '' are i 'm afraid a one-shot once in a lifetime treat never to be repeated on pbs again and never to be available for home media purchase that really sucks i 'm lucky to have caught it when i did oh yeahour local library did get a copy of `` the regard of flight '' and yesit was stolen,1
i found the movie at my local video store and i was surprised to see it on dvd i had heard about the explicit sex scenes gruesome violence and the notorious debauchery i sat and watched and i began laughing the set decorations and art direction was cheap and fake the nudity was sardonic and incredibly unsexy the story was poorly written and it was just a parade of incredibly beautiful and talented actors being held hostage to quote the worst dialogue ever written the incestuous relationship between caligola malcolm mcdowell and his serenely beautiful sister drusilla theresa ann savoy a vulnerable beauty ca n't be taken seriously ... it 's not even shocking or repulsive peter o'toole and john geilgud were obviously held hostage during the making of this film luckily they die in the first thirty minutes of the film the cinematography was a joke and i was even more amused when they used a quote from the bible the book of mark no less if you are looking for shock value this movie will disappoint you if you are looking for camp cult value you will be even more disappointed i know i was i have seen shocking and this is two hours of your life you will never have back,0
there is not one character on this sitcom with any redeeming qualities they are all self-centered obnoxious or two dimensional my husband watches it claiming that there is nothing else on but i would rather watch nothing the only sitcom that i can think of that was worse was yes dear at least that one did n't get 9 seasons being overweight does not make a comic genius and kevin james does not have the talent of john goodman jackie gleason or john belushi leah remini may have talent but if so she is wasted on the shrewish wife jerry stiller is convincing as an annoying old man maybe there is a reason for that this is a perfect example of why sitcoms are derided,0
in out made me want to vomit i have never seen such a shameless film it seriously wanted to say that being gay is something wonderful and joyous but has no idea how to say it to me this was not a comedy unless cruel sick jokes are something to laugh at when a victim falls for it from what i saw this film had four 4 major flaws starting with a matt dillion 's character as he announces to the world that is former teacher howard brackett kevin kline is gay never mind how unbelievable it is that matt dillion character won an oscar for what looked like a serious role on the edge of a crack-up but why would he say such a thing after all this was never an issue with howard 's students his friends family nor his finace nobody so why would he say something like it when it was n't true more to the point why does n't the movie supply us with an answer as to why he said it the reason is because there is no answer and for the convenience of the plot none is provided the second b flaw is with the fact the film seems to have forgotten what homosexuality is -- the attraction and sexual relation to members of the same sex in this movie being gay is based on liking barbara streisand musicals and being passionate about literature it 's all based on stereotypes both of these flaws are met up again at that must-be-seen-to-be-believed graduation ceremony matt dillion finds out about the commotion going on in that small town and the film looks poised to let us know what made him say such a thing when he arrives to the ceremony he says nothing and i wondered why in the world he then came there at all he did n't solve anything then when all of the audience stood to announce they were gay i was so moved i wanted to throw up those folks were standing up in defense of howard being gay by mocking all of those stereotypes what the film forgot is that it was using those stereotypes to show why howard was gay they filmmakers just shot themselves in the foot but wait there 's more during the ceremony c howard appeared to be on trial to lose is job as a teacher because people believed that he would influence his students to be gay what the film was trying to say is that homosexuals never recruit and that he would n't influence his students but did we not see tom selleck 's character endlessly pressure howard over and over again even to the point of kissing him unexpectedly to come out of the closet when in my mind there was no closet to come out of from that the film clearly show that homosexual are capable of recruiting the film again then shoots itself in the foot and d when howard came out of the closet did anyone not notice how the screenplay shut him up for the rest of the film i counted only three lines he had afterwards `` yup '' to his parents `` hi there '' to a student and `` are you ready '' to tom selleck before the last vomitous scene i might be low by one but the point is he is not allowed to tell us what made him decide he was gay i wanted to know what was in his head because i never for once believed he was gay as bonuses the movie also includes several truly offensive scenes one in which howard is asking a priest in confession for advice about what to do for a friend him who is engaged and has not yet had sex with his fiance `` does that make him gay '' he asks the priest responsed `` oh yes he 's definitely gay '' uh-huh or what about the scene when all the old ladies are gathered around telling howard 's mother that she does n't need to be sad about her son 's deep dark secret because well ... everyone has them then one the ladies confessed that she 's never seen `` the bridges of madison county '' funny no becuase the film shows that it is insensitive and has no idea how devestating it can be to family to have one of its members announced that he/she is gay i know i have several friends that are gay and none of their families took it well at all that was a poor way to diffuse the whole situation the last straw for me was the last scene that gave they appearence that tom and kevin were getting married the camera panned down very slowly to the front of the church when ... it was n't what you thought i had been thoroughly disgusted by that point and i never could forgive that sick joke i have nothing against films about being gay or homosexuality `` philadelphia '' and `` longtime companion '' were very honest and true in what they had to say `` in out '' is just screaming for political correctness but has no idea of the corruption at its core what i gathered from the film is that if you are 99 straight and 1 gay meaning if you have the slightless doubt you are definitely gay it 's like gayness is becoming a dominant trait in genetics in reality if everyone told you over and over that you were worthless and stupid you would eventually believe it too would n't you this is what happened to howard brackett about being gay i left the theater sad and angry angry the whole weekend in fact this was a seriously sick and cruel film the worst of 1997,0
book of revelations starts very well daniel an egomaniac dancer is kidnapped abused and sexually raped by three masked women after that nothing else really happens there is some hint of rediscovery but the movie gives nor explanation nor a real ending daniel reactions after the abuse are very basic he quits dancing has sex with every women around and finally starting a relation with very simple and common woman i have seen a good share of art-house movies but this has something missing in it the main leads are fine but some characters does not seems to be completely defined,0
okay anyone looking to see a great work of art should not watch this film a sophisticated film connoisseur will no doubt be nauseated by the horrid production values and the sight of watching an excellent actor joseph cotten whoring himself out for a buck mr. cotten must have either really needed the money or he was too senile to realize that the film was crap the same phenomenon occurred with dana andrews who late in his career appeared in the campy and awful frozen dead i know mr. andrews was in the throes of alcoholism but why did cotten do this mess as for the plot it 's a reworking of the frankenstein plot the first half of the movie really looked as if they were doing a serious but seriously flawed version of the original frankenstein story then inexplicably they introduced a daughter this was n't a bad thing ... until then out of the blue they decided to stop making a horror film but make a soft-core pornographic flick the change was dramatic and bizarre it was almost as if they said `` okay mr. cotten is done with his scenes and has gone home .... now ladies ... strip '' the problem is that on every level the film is just awful except for the monster 's makeup while not great it is still pretty cool to see but bad writing acting and a budget of 17.46 conspired to make this a drab and awful flick -- one so bad that tossing in some nudity for the pervs out there should n't be enough to entice anyone to see it,0
i watch lackawanna blues every time it comes on it brings back happy times for me i grow up in a big city in the mid-west it reminds me of when i was a child although my situation was a little different it feels the same it makes me wonder if all we will ever know about families are lost the big mama 's of day are under the age of 55. will they see know what it takes to be a inspiration to other i hope that i was not the only one who loved this movie enough to relate it to their past the music was great in this movie i truly felt like this should have gone to the theaters i would have paid to see it as i viewed the movie for the second time i figured out who life this movie was about he did an superb job in writing and producing this film i guess who better to produce a film based on your life other than you as soon as i can i will be obtaining a copy for my home use i alway enjoy black producer or directors they make such film feel like you were actually living in the time right than thanks for such a great movie,1
from the point of budget 2.5m cad is n't very much when you look at the animatronics puppetry in this film that alone being the reason for the 9 week shoot i was really keen to see this film and had hoped to catch it when it came out instead got it on dvd recently my main problem is it 's just not funny at all it 's better than tenacious d which has n't got a funny bone in it 's body but this was a truly disappointing film trevor matthews is a very strong physically performer but his acting sucks rachel skarsten gives what is possibly one of the most irritating and none funny performances i have ever seen the only really big star in this is david scott who 's artwork for the monsters is fab his special effects work is the main reason this film is worth watching loved the cyclops and troll and and the prof monster was straight out of the henson library if you watch this it wo n't be the biggest waste of time but if you are looking to see this for a great horror comedy romp ... do n't bother,0
like in `` les amants du pont-neuf '' two outsiders lives a love story without concessions the film consists out of a lot of interesting conversation and a lot of sweet moments the best one comes in a listening booth they listen to a record together and once in a while they look at each other they talk they like each other she suggests a change in their lives but he is out of hope the realistic stylestrokes over the realistic but emotive dialogs a really mathematic screenwriter 's work for this film spanish novel director jesus ponce creates one of the most perfect gallery from the latest year of spanish cinema,1
each story has a lesson for young and old but what more i have to say may spoil a future story but i believe what i have to say is for everyone just for one particular episode the soldier and death okay ... of all the stories the one that sticks out for me is `` the soldier and death '' because is was the point in my life i realized that life was terminal i am not kidding the airing was on my 8 1/2 birthday ... and i will always remember it i did n't remember its title until tonight but i new the synopsis may 15th 1988 it is always difficult to explain that death is a natural part in life it is also difficult for adults to accept that children can accept this fact i am living proof currently 28 yrs old that children can accept this fact and from time to time remind adults ... i write this with tears in my eyes heath ledger a wonderful actor my own age died today it kinda reminded me of many lessons i have learned in my life so i write this as a reminder to young and old ... no one is immune to whatever is in store for us i hate to say that death is going to happen but this story was the first time i saw death as not a bad thing but a part of life was quite literally in this story i ca n't help it it was a life changing moment for me and will alway be and for that ... i love you jim henson and i still remember much of your work in life up until the day you died and your memorial muppet show and thank you brian henson for keeping the workshop alive honest i do thank you all of your co-workers editors and interns the stage is just a stage/ and a show is just a show/ but imagination will create magic/ that forever the world will know thank you and for all who doubt me ... dance magic dance,1
having seen the full length film kieslowski made out of this episode of `` the decalogue '' years ago came back to this viewer as we watched the complete ten vignettes as with the other films this one is loosely based on the fifth commandment or `` thou shalt not kill '' kryzsztof kieslowski writing with kryzsztof piesewicz took a look at the mind of a young man who commits a heinous crime in murdering an innocent person to vent his own frustrations this installment has a dostoyevskian character that kept reminding us about `` crime and punishment '' or at least some of the qualities of the novel are passed to the aimless youth who apparently has no redeeming qualities the story shows the young man as he roams the streets of the city without a clear idea of what to do or where to go the only tender moment he displays is when he visits the photographer 's place to ask to have an old picture of his sister restored kieslowski leaves it up to fate to have the murderer board a taxi with the intention of robbing the driver but it 's his anger and frustration that get the best of this youth to kill a man that did n't deserve to die the last moments of this criminal is one of the most gripping sequences in any film past or present the other element in the story is the relationship between the public defendant and the criminal nothing can prevent the court to condemn to death the young man the lawyer feels at the end he has failed his client and goes to the judge to see where he went wrong all he is asked by the young man is to retrieve the picture and send it to his mother kieslowski 's account of how he interprets the fifth commandment makes for a surprising film that will stay in the viewer 's mind long after this episode is forgotten,1
first off the first thing that came to my mind after i finished this film last night was `` why the title of 8mm 2 `` because i saw the first one obviously and what did this have to do with the first movie 's plot the only thing that was similar was the fact that the couple had to go into the porno industry and that was n't even needed in the plot because after you see the ending that i will not spoil it just did n't make any sense a diplomat and his fiancée are in hungary and notice a woman who is swimming naked in the pool area she 's very attractive so when they see her at a club they decide to have a little fun and have a steamy threesome but things get extremely intense when the diplomat is mailed pictures of them all having the affair fearing that it might go public and jeopardize his career they pay off the guy who sent the pictures the diplomat freaks out and `` kills '' the guy leading into a murder case he and his fiacee decide to find the girl they had the affair with but things just get deeper and darker as they go further into what they got themselves into what could have been an alright thriller turned into an unexplained and not well thought out movie which was sad like i said the title really has nothing to do with the first one so do n't fall for it it 's just a sexual thriller that makes no sense but it 's good for those nights alone because quite frankly this is one of those films where it 's so close to porn that it might as well be labeled as soft core 4/10,0
i would agree with another viewer who wrote that this movie recalls the offbeat melanie griffith/jeff daniels comedy `` something wild '' in which a rather eccentric free-spirit hooks up with a conservative and very orderly young man and the two pose as a couple and basically her personality gradually has an effect on him he looses up and learns to enjoy their short-lived tryst that is exactly what happens here except insert convenient store-robbing eccentric alex rosanna arquette in melanie griffith 's role and super-cautious teen lincoln the name is no coincidence played by devon gummersall in jeff daniel 's part this movie even shares the same twist and abrupt genre change where the creepy violent boyfriend suddenly shows up in the end and things end up quite badly only here instead of it being ray liotta playing a throwback to 1950s film goons it 's peter greene the story is about a teenage kid who is in his own little world he has some sort of fascination with death following his brother 's suicide and his parents have disconnected too behaving quite strangely the mother is convinced christmas will be arriving shortly despite it being august then on a night out with the `` guys '' one of whom is played by jason hervey of the wonder years trying to buy them beer he runs into alex who decides to kidnap him and his friends car with his permission of course and they take off for mini-adventure across the deserts of the west coast robbing convenient stores in robin hood sort of fashion and of course indulging in the routine self-discovery as each asks more about the other 's life but alex has left behind a partner in her trade of theft and he is n't going away easily although we 're not consistently reminded of him or anything as in repetitive flashback or cutting over to his point of view at least this much was done cleverly 'do me a favor aka trading favors is a mostly underdeveloped story of criminal mischief and self-discovery that lags quite a bit for the first half of the film but delivers the goods a little to late once alex and lincoln arrive at her home out in the middle of nowhere by the time the filmmakers give you enough stimulation the film is unfortunately almost over i would recommend that if this is the sort of story you 're in the mood for and despite rosanna arquette always giving a good performance even in a poorly written film i would still recommend catching this in its best form `` something wild '',0
this film looks great and that 's about where my praise ends `` love is a many splendored thing '' came out in the very schizophrenic year of 1955 when candy-coloured nonsense like this co-existed with trail-blazing artistic fair like `` kiss me deadly '' as a trend toward smaller socially conscious films like `` on the waterfront '' and `` marty '' established itself in the mid-50 's other directors felt the need to stick with the unchallenging pandering melodrama that classifies so many other films from that decade and `` love '' is one of the latter this is the kind of 50 's movie where the technicolor is used to its garish utmost and the lighting is invariably high-key even scenes taking place in a dark room or at night are brighter than the average sunny day i never want to hear the theme song again as it 's played frequently enough over the course of the film to last anyone a lifetime and i certainly do n't want to hear it sung by the shrill ear-piercing choir that belts it out over the end titles jennifer jones and william holden are passable but really anybody could have played these parts jones role is horribly written -- her character is incredibly inconsistent and it seems as if whenever her character is required to make a decision about something the screenwriters flipped a coin to decide what that decision would be people will undoubtedly tell me i 'm taking this film too seriously that i 'm unromantic etc but i loved `` all that heaven allows '' released the same year and just as cornball in its own way except that douglas sirk is able to turn melodrama into an art form whereas henry king director of `` love '' is not i 'm usually able to enjoy bad melodrama but in this case i was just bored grade d+,0
hayao miyazaki 's latest and eighth film for studio ghibili `` gake no ue no ponyo '' ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disney/pixar 's cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional hand-drawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories the story revolves around the friendship between a magical sea sprite/goldfish and the human child that she encounters during a curious outing to see the human world the human child sosuke doi hiroki lives in a small house on a cliff overlooking a small port city in southern japan based on seto island where he lives with his young mom lisa yamaguchi tomoko sosuke names the strange goldfish `` ponyo '' and takes it to the daycare/nursing center that lisa works at ponyo is definitely not your typical goldfish and soon begins to adapt and take on human aspects she develops human speech and an appetite for ham meat by sampling some blood from a cut on sosuke 's finger yet just as sosuke and ponyo begin to develop a bond ponyo is taken back by her father fujimoto tokoro joji who is a former human who has rejected the surface world and is now attempting to collect and develop magical elixirs taken from the sea that aid him in repairing and rejuvenating the world 's oceans ponyo 's desire to become human has become so strong however that fujimoto is unable to contain her anymore and she takes on a more human appearance and breaks free from her water world home and goes back to see sosuke during her breakout ponyo unintentionally releases fujimoto 's cache of magical elixirs which unleashes all sorts of magical sea creatures that causes a violent storm in the seas surrounding sosuke 's town desperate to resolve ponyo 's rebellion he soon calls upon the help of his beautiful wife ponyo 's mother the water elemental mother/lady of the sea amami yuki as with his past films miyazaki 's `` gake no ue no ponyo '' touches upon various themes of ecology and environmentalism this time focusing on the health and vitality of the world 's oceans the opening sequence is at times sobering when ponyo encounters a drudging vessel which is scraping the ocean 's floor uncovering mountains of garbage and debris one can understand the anger and frustration of the character of fujimoto who has spent his lifetime trying to repair the damage civilization is doing to its oceans yet finding it an daunting and almost fruitless endeavor enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film it is at times bizarre and outrageous but at the same time charming and curious clearly miyazaki wanted to capture the sense and style of a child 's imagination the art style has the appearance of crayon/pencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful it is almost like a child 's color book come to life child actors nara yuria and doi hiroki do great work as ponyo and sosuke they bring adorable charm to their roles nara yuria in particular sounds so darn cute as ponyo that it is little wonder that doi 's sosuke falls for the magical girl former campaign girl/model and actress yamaguchi tomoko shichinin no otaku swallowtail is also very good in her role as sosuke 's modern mom lisa i was a bit confused at first by her character as i initially thought she was sosuke 's older sister it also did n't help that sosuke kept referring to her as `` lisa '' rather than mom but i guess it is perhaps a sign of the times and an indicator of the modern japanese family in the anime series crayon shinchan shinnosuke also refers to his mom by first name as well 80s comedian tokoro joji sounds totally different as the serious fujimoto but wisely does n't make his character sound cartoony villainous or goofy menacing while we do n't get to know his character more former pro-baseball player and actor nagashima kazushige who portrays sosuke 's father koichi also delivers some nice voice work the opening theme `` umi no okasan '' by japanese soprano masako hayashi is simply beautiful and stirring in contrast the fujimaki fujioka and nozomi ohashi `` geke no ue no ponyo '' theme is light and amusing and evokes images of a traditional japanese nursery rhyme during one brilliant sequence the soundtrack takes on an almost wagnerian operatic sound with music that sounds like `` die walküre '' the film is not perfect however and does suffer from moments where the central story of ponyo and sosuke takes a back seat to some of miyazaki 's overwhelming fantastical visuals i also had wished we had more time to explore fujimoto 's back-story as well as the relationship between sosuke and his father like `` kiki 's delivery service/majo no takkyubin '' `` howl 's moving castle '' `` princess momonoke/momonoke hime '' and `` my neighbor totoro/tonari no totoro '' `` gake no ue no ponyo '' is another miyazaki classic that is a marvelous feast for the eyes like a modern day fairytale the film tells a timeless story of friendship and love that will surely be cherished in years to come,1
kidman and law lack the chemistry to make this sloppily directed poorly written romance/melodrama work on any level other than grandiosity kidman pouts and pines wistfully for her absent lover law she 's just met him when he 's whisked off to do battle for the south in the civil war and they 've only exchanged about 5 sentences and one kiss yet they 're totally smitten law 's main direction throughout seems to be look vacant and shell-shocked but sensitive rene zellweger is about the only spark in this dreary script but she plays it way too broad and over the top like she was starring in annie get your gun yee-hah boy howdy something about her character felt more like it belonged in a monty python sketch the one from holy grail where the peasants spend all their time wallowing in muck making mud pies for no reason kidman is a smart enough actress to stay out of her way whenever she can their scenes together are like a comic book hidden inside a victorian era novel whenever the action bogs down into total tedium which is frequently all the writers do is shout cue the simon legree-type villain and teague ray winstone comes galloping out of nowhere to do his unspeakably dastardly acts like kill and torture innocent god-fearing townspeople in the name of loyalty to a fast-fading confederacy all other times he 's missing in action which is preposterous even in this cornball script there is a plethora of other talented actors who give credible performances in small roles these are the characters law meets as he does his johnny appleseed trek from the front lines where he has deserted to the hopefully loving embrace of kidman back in cold mountain ultimately though none of these characters matter law has no time for them or their lives each of these little mini-movies has the same tired theme war is gol-durn heck and turns otherwise decent christian folk into rabid animals and the script is far too predictable too heavy-handed moreover the pacing of the story is dreadfully slow you spend the entire movie waiting for romeo and juliet 's inevitable reunion with kidman wringing her hands and sighing law overcoming incredible odds and dodging bullets and when it finally comes you just do n't care anymore you 'll be looking at your watch wondering how much more of this clap you have to endure i give it one star out of five for the battle scenes there is a potent anti-war message here the incredible lack of concern for the loss of life by the generals on both sides of the conflict is powerful stuff but it 's only about 15 minutes of this 150-minute dog,0
i watched this on sky tv late one night as i am a vampire fan i must admit i half expected it to be a b-movie disaster but i was pleasantly wrong subspecies is about a family of vampires when a vampire lord dies his two sons the handsome and noble stefan and his brother the evil hideous radu start a war with each other over their birth right the bloodstone the bloodstone is a holy grail of sorts for vampires and it bleeds the blood of saints which give the vampire who drinks it an ultimate high the fight for the bloodstone takes an unexpected turn when 3 college students turn up in the brothers territory on a school trip and stefan has to protect them from his brothers lusts like i said i went into this film not expecting much at all but it was one of the best low budget movies i have ever seen the sets and locations romania i think been a while since i 've seen it are very nice and the music score did the film justice most of the acting was adequate but its anders hove as the evil radu that steals the movie and all the subsequent sequels hove 's performance as the twisted vamp is truly breathtaking and bumps the film simply from okay to pretty d mn good,1
ever since he played a goon in lone wolf mcquade actor/stuntman kane hodder has been busy his film hatchet got all the publicity last year but he still makes a couple of more films every year he should have skipped this one hodder seems to be the king of the slashers he has played jason voorhees from 1988 's friday the 13th part vii the new blood 1988 to jason x 2001 he is working on a new film that appears to be a halloween remake he is very much what i would call the serial killer type with his methodical expressionless thirst for blood however there was n't much blood in this movie and very little action occurred on camera it felt as if i was watching an episode of real law enforcement on a e i wo n't put the blame entirely on hodder 's shoulders as the rest of the actors did n't contribute much either michael berryman the hills have eyes the devil 's rejects just ran his mouth until gein shut him up adrienne frantz `` the bold and the beautiful '' was cute veteran actress `` three 's company '' and penthouse pet priscilla barnes did a credible job i am sure there are other horror favorites but they all just seemed to run through their roles,0
this movie was n't the best ... but it did have some good actors in it isiaiah washington was pretty good as a homeless guy guy torrey was good as his handicapped brother ice-t was humorous as the landlord and surprisingly ... the actress tami roman was good as the judge in the movie i did n't even know it was her and i am a die hard real world fan she was totally believable hopefully this movie wo n't hinder these actors development i know that isiaiah has left this movie far behind with the success of grey 's anatomy ice-t with his regular role on nypd special unit and tami roman has landed a recurring role on sex love and secrets upn 's new soap opera i wish the same for the other actors because one bad movie does n't a bad actor make,0
i guess when people say this is beautifully filmed they are talking about the close ups of frogs and the cooking of meals it certainly does n't refer to the set which seems to be composed of about 3 rooms with no outside shots at all also all of it is filmed too close up i got sick of the little boy who keeps farting at miu or pouring hot wax over ants ... also do vietnamese spend all their time sitting on their haunches kind of gross looking at least the way this movie depicts it -- one close up of it would have been plenty not a dozen or more then finally comes part two ... a chick flick for vietnamese girls with the perfect handsome rich man who spends all day playing the piano he is cultured the pretty maid steals him like the forbidden green mango fruit deep except for a few nice close ups this film is a dud it is sort of a soap opera with out dialog it is cloyed how is it beautiful the set looks completely fake no do n't make the mistake i did and rent it because someone recommended it i was expecting beautiful shots of the coastal mountains of vietnam or something when i heard it was a visual gem i wanted to like this movie i like foreign movies even prefer them but this movie is dumb and dull it will leave you irritated that something like this won a bunch of prizes,0
i must confess that i do n't remember this film very well but certainly i liked it i think it was the best adaptation from burroughs novel really and of course it 's one of the best movie from christopher lambert a good movie about tarzan as cult as the ones with weissmuller,1
what a surprise this film was i 've seen a good few of fulci 's horror and zombie flicks and was amazed that this was by the same director he also wrote the screen play which shows that the chap was quite capable of crafting a detailed complex story line the dubbing on this is not good but far from the appalling slop that only further hinders later howlers like 'manhattan baby the photography in this film is fantastic a strange almost futuristic highway appears throughout the film which focuses on a small town where young boys are being murdered a scene involving the beating of a woman is uncomfortable to watch yet refreshing in comparison to usual cinema violence what went wrong lucio perhaps there is a strong case to suggest he had reached his peak with this film and it slowly went downhill after that,1
each guy liv tyler meets loses their head over her not of course without some small encouragement from liv liv is at her beautiful best with matt dillon tops among the paramours interesting initial premise to tell story from perspective of each dupe degenerates into sitcom-style finale not unlike blame it on rio with which it has more than a few similarities worth watching nonetheless,1
this was perhaps the worst movie i 've seen in a long long time forget that it 's clear no research was done regarding detroit forest in downtown detroit bwahaha the writing was horrible the premise completely implausible and quite frankly the characters were embarrassing i can not for the life of me understand why seasoned actors would stoop to such a low and participate in something this god awful now i have never seen the original and do n't know if this movie pays tribute to it 's original form it 's my understanding that the original was not set in detroit why they would deviate from that without researching details about the setting only tells me that it was more than the cast that was looking to pay the rent do n't waste your time on this junk unless you 're from detroit and wish for some comic relief,0
i like so many others on here bought this movie at my local wm in the `` two for 11.00 '' cheap-o bin i love cheesy b horror and sci-fi movies and this one definitely fits in that category pretty much what everyone else on here said is dead on yes it was bad but that was to be expected the `` main '' problem i had with this movie is that it was just basically boring i mean serious yawn-o-rama the acting was bad the costumes k mart skeletor outfit circa 1982 were worse and the editing was awful no continuity whatsoever mr skeletor ultimately dies in an explosion of sorts ... uh although he encountered multiple explosion throughout this move i guess the last one just took its toll on him apparently earlier encounters with this `` military '' group cough took its toll on his horse .... it would change from red to black throughout this crap fest even for a b movie do yourself a favor and skip it the only good it serves me now it to add to my dvd collection hopefully no one will recognize it when they look through my movie collection thumbs down big time,0
keep away from this one the worst thing is the appalling story there seems to be an intent to convey some subtle spiritual/love/friendship message but it is so pathetically devoid of any substance you ca n't help but cringe in addition the majority of screen time is a far below standard story of thieves criminals and our hero es dealing with some alien time travel artifacts i know you are asking for trouble when dealing with time but the story is more full of holes than usual also you have cheap sets bad acting and some of the worst music arrangements in the history of the moving picture overpowering cheap abrupt and disjointed all i can say is `` man alive this film is bad '',0
darr was a super hit film which was loved by many peoples it tells the story of shahrukh khans innocent obsession for juhi who loves sunny deol honestly it was a entertaining movie but if you look carefully its not too realistic shahrukh khan keeps phoning juhi and tells her that he loves her too bits he gives an announcement in college that he loves her and gives her some nice surprises like beautiful photos of her unfortunately instead of being flattered that a guy loves her too bits she gets very very scared i personally know 100s of people that get pranked by someone and these people enjoy it cos they play a long yash chopra gives us a good film that does entertain widely because of shah rukh khan 's character sunny deol is suppose to be the main actor but darr belongs to shah rukh khan delivering a superb performance shah rukh khan is literally the villain of the movie but i would of been happy if he got the girl because he loves her so dearly sunny deol gives a decent performance but he beats up all those guys on his own and survives a brutal knife attack juhi chawla is cute as ever in a fairly good performance some good songs including tu mere samne being the best,1
i looked forward to watching this film since i loved the david lynch version in my first attempt at watching it i fell asleep nothing was happening the next night i tried to watch the rest and again it was putting me to sleep nothing ever happened in this movie that could keep anyone 's interest alive the only time it got a bit more exciting was when i tried it on fast forward the dvd came with a second disk which contained bonus material needless to say i had no hard to go through the torture of watching more of dune 2000 here are the low points the acting was bad the plot moved in slow motion the sets were and looked cheap the direction was pathetic and the cgi visual effects childish if you want to watch dune save your money or rent the 1984 version,0
you got it right bobby was mike 's imaginary friend through the whole movie even at the beginning when on their way to california his mother knew of bobby and did n't discourage mike leaning on bobby since imaginary friends are common with young children that 's why they both got stomach aches at the same time that 's why the boys were so close at the end mike was letting bobby go the `` king '' was arrested mike could go on without bobby it 's also why mike 's mother did n't seem disturbed when mike received the postcard mike had written mailed from bobby the ol west tourist stop and the other postcards from all over the world you noticed mike 's mother turned the first card over and looked at the postmark what a great mom doing the best she could in the late sixties a 9 out of 10 for me brought back memories ...,1
i wrote an essay in 1981 the year i graduated high school called the `` last american virgin '' i also had a friend named nancy who was the prostitute in this film apparently her daughter got a hold of my essay one night when she slept over my house a year later i wake up one morning and see the advertisement for this film i was 18 years old based the essay on experiences in my life the film is a bit different from my essay but definitely taken from it i did not have any proof of this matter except my english teacher mr.versace who gave me an a on my essay.i let it go never did anything about it.i figured what comes around goes around.i still would not take any action against anyone involved in this film i just needed to get it off my chest as i really never told anyone about it except my closest friend they agreed to keep it a secret.the same year it came out i saw nancy in a market she actually had the nerve to ask me if i had any good stories or scripts for her to look at i guess thats what hollywood is all about getting stories from wherever you can.it was interesting seeing parts of my life on the big screen though ghost writer,0
the united states built the atomic bomb in order to show their superior military power and to end the second world war the movie fat man and little boy is a portrayal of the efforts of american physicists to invent the technology necessary to create the bomb and the tension that existed between the scientists and the military over the potential uses of the bomb and even the acceptability of its creation the scientists thought that the bomb should be created as a deterrent a mechanism that would halt the war by wasting as little life as possible fist they saw themselves as in a race with german scientists who were attempting to build nuclear weapons themselves when the germans were defeated many scientists hoped to stop work on the bomb project as they knew that the japanese did not have the technology necessary to build a nuclear weapon and therefore did not pose a threat of massive loss of life those who favored the continuation of the manhattan project hoped that the bomb would be used as a demonstration inviting the japanese head of state to view its deployment upon some tiny deserted island this massive display of force they felt would be enough to win the war-no killing would be needed the us military under the direction of general leslie groves hoped all along to used the bomb as a actual weapon to be deployed against the enemy first against the germans and then against the japanese because of the persistence of japanese soldiers on the small japanese islands the us decided to drop the bomb on populous cities in order to end the war first hiroshima and then nagasaki the display of that vast amount of force also served notice to the rest of the world that the us was the dominant military power a message aimed especially at russia whose growing military power and economic weight in eurasia threatened our preeminent world position fat man and little boy was a movie that had good intentions in mind but muddled them rather badly by the choice of actors script and cinematography one of the main points of the movie was the struggle between the military view of science for killing and the scientific view of science for knowledge the keystone of this conflict is the continued disagreements between general groves and dr. oppenheimer mr. newman does his job in the part of the general craggy massively angry and radiating his dependence upon the success of the project dwight schultz on the other hand never puts up much resistance at all to the general 's demands always looking rather weak deflated and phlegmatic in his audiences john cusack presents a stunningly unsympathetic character in as flat a role as i have ever seen-it looks like he is just reading his lines laura dern seems to be suffering from the same malady none of the characters are helped by the script which is almost childishly ridiculous in the way it attempts to explain scientific concepts unscientifically offers the most unrealistic stock relationship between mr. cusack and ms. dern imaginable does n't even give us the cheap thrill of watching the army drop nuclear bombs on japan and relies heavily on voice-over-a technique that is evil anytime even when explaining a characters true innermost thoughts or for the narration of something that can not be possibly show on the film medium but is used here to read some absolutely trite selections out of cusack 's diary the cinematographer offers us several shots of the ominous shadow of the two bombs which might be striking if it did n't look like they were cardboard cutouts instead of bombs the fake atomic fire really does look fake-and why use it when the stock footage on hand is so genuinely stunning and realistic -- and the pervasive brown tone does n't seem to be thematically appropriate besides that it 's not a bad movie,0
this is one of the movies one has to start watching with an open mind one knows it 's going to about a mute one could look forward to or be afraid for a lot of sentiment well forget it the movie starts with a little black humour and then gets started from then on its takes you on an ever frightening ride through the dark centers of moscow all right it must be said the unexpected twists are expected and the mute is mainly used as a plot tool or fear builder but this movie does n't let you go it 's like the old gangster movies but then without any glamour at all and in russia and that 's one of the most important aspects of this movie it 's situated in russia this does have a great impact on the movie according to me it makes it better everything becomes simple and basic life is without nonsense this could be a great potential for more movies in the future gangster movies about the russian mafia it is a beautifull and terrifying movie it 's horror but you ca n't feel but sympathy for the little mute one last advice do n't look this too late in the evening if you want to sleep well,1
this has to rate as one of the cheesiest of tv shows in a long time jose ferrer played the title character nemo he did the part justice and certainly looked the part but nowadays it strikes me that the nemo he was made up to be bore more than a passing resemblance to captain bird 's eye from the tv commercials or maybe it 's the other way around his nemesis professor cunningham was overacted brilliantly by burgess meredith he never seemed to get over his `` penguin '' days from batman although he does n't do his penguin `` quack '' here he is without parallel as the maniacal professor only john colicos of battlestar galactica fame chewed up the scenery better as a maniacal despot i never can recall what the grudge was between nemo and cunningham but it must have been severe since the prof. never missed a chance to try and scupper nemo and vice-versa the effects were nothing special though prof. cunningham 's submarine was way better looking than nemo 's it also had a crew of strange fish-like amphibians that served cunningham and did his every bidding however the most memorable aspect of the whole show was prof. cunningham 's secret weapon the delta beam he was forever saying `` fire delta beam `` whereupon a fishy crewman would horribly overract the motion of firing the weapon by use of a full shoulder shrug truly priceless they do n't make them like this anymore and perhaps just as well but like other series of this era for those who remember it it will always have an affectionate if cheddar-covered place in our hearts,0
i have to say that i really liked under siege and hard to kill watching seagal doing his funny martial arts on people i have been always looking forward to seagal-movies and unfortunately i was first disappointed by glimmer man which i found really bad the foreigner is probably one of the worst seagal has ever acted in horribly boring badly edited wrongest soundtrack and so on dear reader do yourself a favor an stay away from this honestly stay away,0
the worst movie i 've ever seen i still do n't understand what dennis hopper and michael madsen intend to do in maybe they had bills to pay ... the best and cult part happens during a flashback which brings us during wwii when a nazi officer hide his jewish wife that 's the beginning of a typical serial killer life it seems to be directed during the beginning of the 80 's but then appears a new beattle ... amazing this movie was directed in 2001 ... i 'm quite sure that it took less than two weeks to do that movie i heard that dennis hopper 's wife asked for divorce after she saw that picture and michael madsen 's mother had a heart attack when the actor admitted to be the man under the yellow baseball hat pathetic,0
dr steven segal saves the world from a deadly virus outbreak this movie strikes me as foolish earnestness that has morphed into an unintended camp classic the best kind memorable lines include `` knowledge is like a deer chase it and it will run away from you '' and `` drink this it will make you feel better '' it is so sublimely bad -- they could n't have made it any worse if they tried segal tries to convince you that he is 1. sensitive -- by saving a stricken pony 2. a good father -- by a saccharine cooking scene for his daughter 3. a man of science -- by looking at a fake spectrum 4. in tune with nature -- by using homeopathic remedies 5. politically correct and multicultural -- by having indian friends 6. an iconoclast -- by opening a rural practice after a former life in a national research lab and 7. an action hero -- by being really fat but yet can still fight rotfl it 's good to see on as a late-night saturday flick with friends preferably but not necessarily inebriated,0
this is no doubt one of the worst movies i have seen in a long time i was expecting alot more from the actors it started alright then things go from idiotic to absolutely ridiculous definitely not worth renting except if its a free rental,0
basically this was obviously designed to be promotional material for the movie produced by the same horrible director which happens to be even worse than this documentary and absolutely the worst movie i 've ever seen so avoid it at all costs as for this documentary it 's entertaining entertaining and blatantly misleading most of the `` historical '' looking footage is most likely just that historical footage from completely unrelated events that were sadly cut and pasted into this documentary to make it more dramatic than it would have ever been otherwise there 's no doubt that waverly is a pretty interesting place with plenty of it 's own fascinating history but manufacturing a documentary to market the locale and the related production is for lack of better words appallingly useless and yes i 've lived in kentucky my whole life and i have visited the location numerous times waverly hills deserves respect and there 's nothing respectful about this lame documentary,0
i can only assume the previous posts came from execs at the production company ... attended the uk premiere last night zane and brook attended they probably knew i was gon na be there and are undoubtedly stars but what a turkey of a film i felt sorry for them at times when the audience erupted in laughter at what were serious 'thriller scenes but perhaps i was missing the point perhaps an element of tongue-in-cheek was intended if so pure genius if not career genocide on the plus side zane always shines and brook can actually act a little as the other half said as we ran out the cinema avec broken ribs they can be forgiven for this film as they both seem like nice people the scriptwriter however should be marooned,0
this movie even calling it a movie is an overstatement is ridiculously horrible normally a huge fan of eric roberts in `` b '' list movies this tragedy of a flick makes me question his real b list clout and charlie please go back to hoping for a diagnosis murder revival rather than this ..... you ca n't blame the nameless eye candy uhhum ... beauty pageant members for participating in this weak movie but you are a former tv star man pull yourself together do n't even get me started on stuart pankin for the sake of all that is good stuart you should have seen this was not necessarily a real movie bryan michael stoller exemplifies absolute genius only in the fact that he was able to dupe anyone into investing in this picture money or time really this was no parody or spoof movie although it tries on a 2nd grade level mostly it is poor writing and acting and camera work and editing and .... well poor everything i watched it because i read an article in some mag about agent mj 's involvement and my interest was peaked due to the lawsuit in which he was involved i now wonder if the only reason they show him from the shoulders up in the movie is because he like at the trial showed up wearing pajama bottoms and barely lucid wait a second is he ever really considered lucid ... i digress and agent mj is that the best they could come up with for a name for his character sheez what a startling piece of originality or maybe that was supposed to be funny putting marriott into the movie was a nice touch at first but overdone and annoying after all is said and done spare yourself the grief of watching ...... do n't say i did n't warn you,0
this film screened at the american cinematheque 's egyptian theatre in hollywood on april 7 1999. it was described in the american cinematheque schedule as follows `` tomorrow is another day 1951 warners 90 min steve cochran 's an ex-con who 's never been with a woman ruth roman is a dime-a-dance dame with no use for sappy men a hotel room a dirty cop a gunshot the perfect jump-off for a fugitives-on-the-run love story this virtually unknown noir is felix feist 's masterwork packed with revelatory set-pieces cochran was never more vulnerable roman never sexier imagine gun crazy scripted by steinbeck it 's that good '' i just saw this film and i agree with every word of the above description,1
mgm tried pairing up and coming young men with the divine one to give them exposure and try them out as leading men gable and garbo had chemistry in susan lenox but it was a lousy film here in inspiration there is no chemistry whatsoever between garbo and robert montgomery and the script is poor as well what were they thinking the modern fast-talking wise-crack-snapping montgomery and the long-suffering garbo it is a tale like camille young student falls for woman of the world and is repelled by learning of her past rejects her takes her back rejects her .... you get the picture garbo is completely believable as a top parisian artist 's model and completely at home although bored with her life at the top of society amidst her artistic friends and their loose morals suddenly she is fascinated by this innocent she finally gives up her life for him and sinks into poverty only to be rescued by him and set up in a house of her own ironically he intends to marry and keep her on the side so much for his pure moral ethic of earlier the scenes are incredibly dull and boring and nothing much happens only marjorie rambeau as lulu is able to inject life into the proceedings with such lines as `` unfortunately weak women have strong appetites '' and `` odette where is thy sting '' only for garbo fans,0
as a person who knows the filmed ship and some other ships too i can not see the movie as a movie only as a movie is has some great wonderful shots of the ship most of them done on an existing vessel apart of the ones in the disaster scenes of course and a certain room under deck but regarding the story and dialogs i only can call it big crap nothing of that would happen like this on a real sailing vessel no wonder the film had bad impact on the existing ship if i did n't know better i was n't tempted to do a sailing voyage for sure definitely for europeans i recommend to switch off once the ship ran aground after that the over-emotional very american part begins which i could n't bear the pics are really really great no wonder in a ridley scott film but if you can avoid listening to the text it will become much better,0
lovely music beautiful photography some of scenes are breathtaking and affecting but the dramatic tension is lost in a film that is so poorly edited it is hard to know what exactly is going on at times the dialogue is incomprehensible then there is richard gere he 's supposed to be a factory worker who gets into trouble and gets work on a farm we see dozens of farmhands sweaty and dirty in the hot sun then we see gere looking like he just wandered away from a calvin klein ad sam shepard another glamour guy is supposed to be terminally ill. but he looks great nice try but it just does n't work brook adams try hard but she gets lost in the scenery.the real star is the girl,0
took a very good book and completely butchered it nothing was as it should have been some of the best parts of the book were missing including the major point of the whole book simply the worst adaptation of a stephen king novel ever this movie made the mini-series for it look good,0
faith akin has made me realize once more the deepness of my passion for this city called istanbul being addressed as a city of cultural mosaics faith akin has contributed to that addressing through the mosaics of music performed in the film what 's more the climax of the film in my opinion is the scene where muzeyyen senar a turkish music diva sings at age 86 as well as she had done in her younger years and rolls the raki glass in the air without pouring out one drop which is a traditional act in raki culture she is just marvellous sezen aksu a turkish pop singer with her mystical and meaningful looks at the end of her song which gives the film its turkish title makes the scene no less than a climax last but not least the wonderful scenery of istanbul can make you feel nostalgic if you are away beware,1
this meandering tale of mob revenge is simply not very interesting even with ed mcmahon in a ripe role as the chief heavy jim brown kicks ass effectively gloria hendry proves again that she can bring life to even the poorest roles and brock peters is decent as the cop who plays by the book it 's still dull and badly constructed and even the print shown on cable is now emasculated of its original james brown score,0
many people are standing in front of the house n some women are crying ... men standing in close groups and speaking in hushed up tone ... a couple of guys come in and they are discussing how sexy the daughter might look today ... soon u will know someone in the house has died ... the dead person 's wife is worried about preparing food for so many people her friend sitting beside her gives an idea of making the matters easy by preparing simple roti sabji ... one of the dead person 's son is speaking with someone over the mobile daughter is busy with her makeup ... her mother suggests her to wear salwar kameej but the daughter is more interested in looking good when so many people will be visiting their house and hence prefers jeans and t shirt over salwar kameez ... another son asks her mom to finish all the kriyas and also indicates to her that he should not be expected to come early from the office ... then the camera slowly focuses on the dead person ... the white cloth covering the face is displaced slightly due to the wind revealing the face ... its anupam kher ... suddenly alarm rings and he gets up from the bed ... is it his dream or a flash back u wo n't get an answer until the end of the movie ... well this is wat comedy is for the director dibakar banerjee later u find out this scene has nothing to do with the actual movie and hence making everything obvious that the still described earlier was a dream is this a film comedy well it is supposed to belong to that category ... but it actually does not there is nothing that can be remotely associated with comedy in the movie more over the director gives the message that no one will get justice from police so everyone must cheat the cheats or forget about justice music by bapi-tutul dhruv dhalla is ok ... nothing much to tell about other sectors ... bad script destroys everything ... not even anupam kher 's performance succeeds in making it at least a paisa vasool ...,0
i first saw this film when released in 1980. from other sources i 've learnt that the only release of the 219-minute cut was in new york city after which it was severely cut to 149 minutes so i guess i saw the shorter version first which at the time i thought was a very interesting anti-western if a trifle confusing ... so it was with even more interest that i finally obtained a dvd of the full-length version i 'm glad i did because this second viewing has confirmed for me that the movie is a true classic and the critical vitriol poured on michael cimino was unwarranted to say the very least yes it 's a long movie but so have been many others for example once upon a time in america 1984 at 227 minutes cleopatra 1963 at 320 minutes the ten commandments 1956 at 220 minutes spartacus restored version 1960 at 198 minutes gone with the wind 1939 at 222 minutes and others so it ca n't be the fact of running time that made so many froth at the mouth way back when heaven 's gate came on the scene but note this all of those above movies have everything to do with reinforcing myths about history and heroes not so heaven 's gate in this narrative the american west is shown in all its grim and unrelenting harshness injustice and poverty and that 's probably the first reason why so many disliked this film it laid out the circumstances of the johnson county war of 1892 in wyoming showing how the wyoming stock growers association hired 50 assassins to hunt down and murder a large group of european immigrants accused of cattle rustling and all with the assistance and conniving of authorities right up to the president of the united states for an essay on that war with the background and what happened there is a link at wikipedia under johnson county war very few like to be reminded of the really dirty periods in their country 's history and which fly in the face of what the country is supposed to be had it been a documentary it would have been barely palatable for most as entertainment it was almost bound to fail commercially and be torn to shreds by the shrill and infamous leaving aside the socio-political diatribe for a moment that cimino launched herein what about the narrative  the story of the three main characters well it probably was n't unusual for men of that time to fall for a local prostitute just as it 's probably not unusual now it 's a fairly standard love triangle whereby ella must choose between the two men and ultimately decides upon the younger man nathan who although not above resorting to cold-blooded murder when it suits him shows more spirit and commitment than the older james or jim as most people in the film say for some that part of the story threads too slowly perhaps in the context of the wider narrative about the war however it is i think entirely appropriate and that war is depicted graphically viciously and cruelly with scenes of carnage that are exquisitely staged and edited flawlessly  although in the final massacre between the association and the immigrants i 'm certain that some scenes of wagons blowing apart are repeated a minor point and perhaps brought about when the 219-minute cut was restored any way you look at it though it hits you in the face with the noise dust chaos and confusion of war ... which brings me to another criticism by others the noise and dust is such that it 's often difficult to hear the dialog and even see clearly what is happening i 'll admit that i found that to be a trifle annoying at first even backtracking to replay parts to try to catch the image or the words  until i realized that really was n't necessary if you accept the director 's intent life is chaotic it is difficult to hear and see in crowded situations and in war it 's the sine qua non of this mise-en-scene in short it 's as though you truly are present in and within the scenes ... and what of the title from shakespeare it refers to a figurative nearness to god and so if you equate god with the natural world the stunning scenery that pervades the movie  and it is stunning hauntingly equal to that of david lean 's doctor zhivago 1965  is a useful metaphor i tend to think however that cimino had something more to say namely the idea that the brave immigrants  the god-fearing salt of the earth  were denied entry to heaven on earth and the freedom to build a life for themselves in the land that espouses to be freedom 's champion was that cimino 's intent  to gut the myth of the american west to show how in america only the rich get rich while the poor are massacred one way or another throughout history is that anything new not really as we all know where it really hurt however is in showing how america was not and by implication is not the land of the free and the home of the brave instead after absorbing this narrative we are left with an impression that the underpinnings of america have more to do with a land of dispossessed slaves and a home for knaves ...,1
request you to not watch this movie ... it starts with a promise and as it goes on you crave for the movie to end ... predictable not entertaining at all wasted movie ... save your time and watch better thrillers .... the synopsis sounds good and that is why i watched the movie ... but it was way too predictable with nothing to give you a start ... no great suspense .. no great direction ... nothing phenomenal with the acting ... shy away from this ... low rating ... nothing to write about this movie so i am filling up the remaining lines of text so you can imagine how much a time waster this movie is ... really irritated at how good a premise that was and how bad a screenplay was written out of it ...,0
if the directors/producers/publicists wish to promote a film as `` based on actual events '' and make a film that is meant to inspire and have meaning then for a start to maintain any sort of creditability and integrity you would want to keep a film as honest as you possibly can a team wearing `` all black '' jumpers and doing the haka in america is just plain dumb any half intelligent person would know that the `` all blacks '' are the national rugby union team of new zealand and their jumpers are all black and the haka is performed by them as a part of a traditional maori dance having such stupidity in a movie without explanation merely reduces the credibility of the movie to zero and negates the message and inspiration that the movie is trying to achieve the question is `` why '' why would you do such a stupid thing and for what possible gain i can only conclude that the writers or director or producers have seen it on tv before a international rugby union match and thought `` wow that would be great in our movie no one will know that it never happened they 're all too dumb to know about nz nd the all blacks this will be great '' how would an americian audience react to a movie made in nz about americain grid iron with a team wearing an american indian costumes and war paint doing a native american indian war dance running round in circles shouting `` oh woo woo woo oh woo woo woo '' react they 'd laugh their heads off the people that made this movie and the industry that spawned it really should have their heads read for some reason the industry thinks that they can `` fool all the people all the time '' it 's just dumb,0
i just watch this move recently on encore channel what a great film a great cast as well flatliners is very suspenseful and unpredictable the movie has a great opening scene by the ocean then to a series of scene establishing the questions about life after death which provide a very strong upfront story involvement therefore nelson played by kiefer sutherland was the first to go through the test to die and come back to life then it 's gets very dramatic by bringing back his wrong doing from the past to life then all of the above mentioned characters went through the same experience except for randy steckle played by olliver platt then the story unfold into a resolution and basic understanding about life and the presence and meaning of god david labraccio played by kevin bacon an atheist end up questioning his own belief about god it 's amazing to watch julia roberts along with kevin bacon oliver platt william baldwin and kiefer sutherland at such a prime time of their careers one can ask how come we do n't have such great movie produced anymore this is one of the best productions from joel schumacher i really enjoy this movie,1
latest attempt to revive the series actually based on a pretty good idea but without the required gore fx/violence for this type of thriller and thus ... boring good special fx sets costumes etc but the film comes of just plain silly and a near-waste of time ... hopefully the next installment will correct this problem,0
there 's only one thing i 'm going to say about cat in the hat ... as a kids movie and a good comedy movie it sucks ... i lost track of how many terrible jokes in the movie that not only sucked but were n't exactly kid appropriate oh and by the way the way the cat in the hat talked was annoying ... as for the plot i completely forgot who cares it sucked anyway i 'm not sure why mike myers joined but i think the writers were trying to make it sound like him in austin powers without the swinger talk and it overly succeeded- but so what it was annoying do n't see it-it belongs in the bottom 100 .............................. the jokes are so unkiddy it 's funny,0
zoey 101 is such a stupid show i do n't know if that 's because the snooty jamie lynn spears is the prissy star of it or what but i just know that the show sucks it 's about a girl and her brother who go to a boarding school the jokes in this show are extremely dull and unfunny and i hate every single character except chase and lola heck the jokes on this show are so unfunny that they make jack black look like monty python.this show is without a doubt one of the worst shows on nickelodeon it 's right down there with avatar and danny phantom in the pit of shame and if this show was a person with any honor it would hang itself in shame 1/10,0
maybe i expected too much of this film but at the very least a comedy should be funny and this one has very few amusing moments it manages to be insulting to homosexuals heterosexuals women the obese and probably several other groups as well the scene at graduation where _everyone_ claims to be gay is one of the most distasteful i have ever seen tom selleck and matt dillon are ridiculously miscast and kevin kline seems bemused most of the time other reviewers compare the film to `` will and grace '' but at least `` will and grace '' _is_ funny,0
the way i found out about this movie was when i watched american pie 2 at the start it had a trailer for ali g indahouse i watched the trailer and it just forced me to buy the dvd it looked incredibly funny so the next day i went to my local store and picked it up for £3.99 bargain the film is about ali g who is a `` gangster '' of the west staines massive crew who 's rivals are the east staines massive crew ali has a `` cub scout '' pack of children where he teaches them how to survive in the `` ghetto '' by teaching them how to swear and steal cars after ali finds out the government are stopping the money coming to the leisure centre where ali teaches the kids he runs for mp for staines and overthrows another mp in his attempts to get rid of the leisure centre to make room for an airport in staines throughout the film there are laughs aplenty as ali gets up to some crazy stuff borat makes an appearance for a few seconds in the film too this is a definite must watch film for all you sacha baron cohen fans out there,1
david morse and andre braugher are very talented actors which is why i 'm trying so hard to support this program unfortunately an irrational plot and very poor writing is making it difficult for me i 'm hoping that the show gets a serious overhaul or that the actors find new projects that are worthy of them,1
i saw this film at the galway film fleadh the year it won best short film i have to say that i thought the direction was fantastic and the performances from the key cast members were very memorable both of the main cast are definitely names to watch out for the final shot over the cliff was mesmerizing and i for one would like to find myself there if i was waiting for the end of the world to happen the kiss was definitely a great payoff done with great enthusiasm 's i can only assume that the film was shot on film and i have heard that the dop won an award at the tribeca film festival for his work on this film and i must say .... well deserved i would recommend this film to anyone who was a teenager in the 1980s it brought back some great memories and some scary ones,1
jack-o 1995 was a really bad movie we are talking snoozefest x 100 no entertainment value whatsoever no budget no gore z-grade actors etc etc this film was an awful addition to the horror movie industry and should n't have been made the only reason i purchased this movie was because i knew linnea quigley was in it and sure enough she does her obligatory nude shower scene which is lovely yes but as for the film itself ........ i fell asleep at the 40 minute stage and had no desire at all to finish it it 's just bigtime lame ok. i love horror movies i 'm an avid fan a massive fan i love low budget horrors i love it all but i hated this rubbish so i think that will tell you all you need to know about `` jack-o '' i give this movie 2/10 the `` 2 '' is for the 2 minute linnea shower scene the movie itself is a total zero,0
i need help identifying an episode of king of queens it begins with a scene where doug is talking to carrie on the phone and he suggests that they agree to stop ending every conversation with `` i love you '' however it 's hard to do and he ends up calling her back only to close with `` i love you '' it 's a very clever moment and one i think says a lot about relationships that have lasted a long time i think but i 'm sure that 's it 's the same episode where doug gets some local construction guys to whistle and throw lurid comments at carrie to perk her spirits up i saw this episode recently but it was probably a repeat do n't know what network i saw it on can anyone tell me the title and season of this episode,1

my husband dragged me to this film as i had no interest in seeing some anime cartoon i was absolutely delighted by the simple story and amazing animation in a digital world where effects are computer generated it was refreshing to see gorgeous imaginative hand drawn animation the world of sosuke and ponyo is a vivid fantasyland intermixed with minimal reality i have n't seen animation like this since i was a child and it is wonderful to see it endure and succeed the actors supplying the voices in the english version were fabulous the length of the movie was perfect especially for children who tend to get squirrelly in films overall a delightful experience worth the very expensive ticket prices we have nowadays,1
i do n't know what has happened to director abel ferrara ever since the `` body snatchers '' remake he seems to have lost it `` king of new york '' and `` the bad lieutenant '' remain two of the best films of the '90s searing indictments of a decade gone wrong with films like `` r xmas '' whatever that means and `` new rose hotel '' he seems determined to disgust and bore his former supporters this film has no life in it while he gets excellent performances out of his actors in all of his projects the result of this mishmash of ideas just does n't jell whatever the point is -- that the new breed of drug dealer is more or less the same as any other upper middle class new yawkuh -- gets lost in the mind numbing script and boring direction i saw this opening night at the 4-plex in downtown l.a. in the lobby while buying tickets i was surprised and delighted to see it filled with a large racially mixed group of men and women in their twenties and thirties then they started into the theater but it was the theater that was featuring `` 8 mile '' not `` r xmas '' the theater showing `` r xmas '' keep in mind this was opening night had a total of 4 people watching it myself my wife and two others way to go abel 2/10,0
i grew up in the 90s therefore you must understand that i witnessed firsthand the premiers of the greatest dcoms i was there when brink appeared zenon halloweentown johnny tsunami etc these movies constitute my childhood when these movies came on not only myself but whoever i was watching them with would stand completely in awe for 1h30 talk about it for the week to come and catch it again the next weekend i do n't think words could express the amount of excitement zoog disney brought even when i watch them now the dialog does n't seem that bad so effective in fact that i actually remember parts of conversations literally word per word from movies i saw over ten years ago the characters are believable funny granted a little stereotypical but that 's what makes disney 's charm ... i sat my little brother down in front of the disney channel to try and convey and make him understand my feelings for dcoms enter stuck in the suburbs ... my brother looked at me slightly puzzled asking me if i had always been gay i feel more disappointed and betrayed now than what could i compare this to when han solo found out lando sold him out to vader ... half the movie and i 'm not exaggerating is flashbacks there is no talent in these young actors some of which are older than i am whatsoever the plot is ridiculous it feels like a bunch of old rotting corporate people over at disney sat around a table and asked themselves `` how can we seem hip to these youngsters '' ok maybe all the dcoms were like that but they at least made a little effort to not let us realize they think we 're complete idiots and apparently this type of movie works ... stuck in the suburbs is rated almost as much as zenon or airborne how is this possible dcoms got even cheesier and people prefer them now though apparently the lack of curse words is enough to give it 10/10 for some people christ it 's a completely different generation,0
unfortunately this movie is absolutely terrible it 's not even laughably bad just plain bad the actors do their best with what is the cheesiest script ever how scary can a movie be when the climax actually involves a roomful of millions of styrofoam peanuts,0
for all its many flaws i 'm inclined to be charitable towards `` thing '' there is the nugget of an interesting creepy claustrophobic hitchcock style story here put this in the hands of a writer like theodore sturgeon or if you prefer british perspective robert bloch or the guy who wrote `` day of the triffids '' and you might have had a nasty unsettling little spook story that was the best thing in an book anthology of horror and suspense stories however someone chose to tell this story as a feature length movie and a cheap 2nd rate at that and so most of the potential is wasted a story like this really needs a voice like sturgeon 's to bring out interesting quirks of character in a better light his classic story `` the -widget- the -wadget- and boff '' is an example of how he can gather together an isolated group of `` ordinary '' characters and in the space of 40 pages can turn them into the most amusing sympathetic and fascinating people you 've ever met a good writer can with a few chosen words make the reader `` see '' some of the most vivid and memorable events ever to scar his emotions instead we get a movie where some of the most irritating and unlikeable characters ever made are lumped together and made to interact in unconvincing `` where did that come from '' moments that just lie there ie the blond psychic girl declaiming that `` you 're all evil and i hope you are destroyed '' we get leaden pacing and slow motion blocking and dull sets and stiff actors i blame the director for the 'stiff and shallow part these are all 3rd rank character actors who never made the big time but they are also 'real actors and a good director could have gotten better performances out of them we get uncalled for lesbian overtones that make the viewer feel uneasy and exploited without delivering any kind of payoff if i 'm going to have my baser instincts exploited and feel guilty about it i want done by stuff staged better than this and we get over an hour of creepy build-up diffused in about 35 seconds in one of the worst anti-climaxes i 've ever seen good things about `` thing '' um well ... some of the closeup shots of the warlock 's head silently mouthing its directives were pretty effective the miserly and shrewish widow rang true to life even if i wanted to stuff a sock in her mouth the first scene where the big `` simple '' ranch hand silently turns on the oily cowboy and kills him had a bit of shock value because the plot had taken the trouble to establish the big guy as a fairly sympathetic character and like i said earlier the idea of an insidious force from the past turning the members of an isolated community against each other is a good one and can sustain interest far above the actual merit of a bad performance which this definitely is but as i said i 'm inclined to be charitable because the director was probably working under a penurious budget breakneck time constraints and the best actors he could find for the money heaven knows how future generations will judge facile crap like `` the cave '' `` wrong turn '' or the remake of `` house of wax '' 40 years from now i hope they are charitable towards our own tastes in supporting our generations wastes of film stock,0
this flick was even better then 'waiting for guffman the great strength in these two films lie in the brilliant character acting by guest and levy 's little second-second city troupe if one finds this movie boring or pointless god help 'em they just did n't get it it is a mockumentary something at which guest and levy have a genius for at the end of the movie where guest 's southern down home dog lover tells us that to relax after the show he went to israel to work on a 'caboose or when he tells us that ventriloquism is an ancient art and we see a hieroglyphic of an ancient egyptian holding a tiny ancient egyptian in it 's hand i realized it is moments like this that make life worth living thank you mr.guest and mr.levy and god bless you,1
if you like to get a couple of fleeting glimpses of cleavage on some attractive women there may be a second or two of enjoyment from this film if you enjoy seeing poorly conceived and executed `` action '' scenes there are plenty if you are both blind and deaf i still advise you to not have this film on in your presence it is surely the worst or very close to the worst film i have ever seen and it does appear that there was some money spent on it talk about throwing money away as an editor i would hope that the `` editor s '' of this `` movie '' never again be allowed to edit a film book or even a post-it note as a writer i would hope that the author s never again be allowed near even a broken crayon you would think that i am not recommending that you view this movie not so tape it so you may stop your pain when you need to and educate yourself as to how bad a movie can be,0
oh boy films like this really bother me if this movie is supposed to close to truth then i assume that rommel knew hitler for a time before wwii started in the movie rommel mentions how hitler had changed from before well i ca n't imagine that rommel would n't have known something about hitler 's government policies so rommel must share some guilt for the german atrocities with that in mind i have a problem with a movie that makes rommel 's life at the end a tragic one he made his choices and we have to feel bad for him i ca n't do it i also ca n't buy the theory that if the more competent generals were allowed to fight the war the allies would have had more trouble winning it if more competent people were in charge wwii may never have started in the first place from a movie watching aspect the film jumps from place to place and most of the time seems like a history special with big name actors playing the historical roles leo g. carroll has a couple of good scenes with james mason and i liked the fact that everyone spoke english without the ridiculous accents but other than that not very essential,0
so far miguel bardem 's career it 's been one of the more dreadful of recent spanish cinema he 's made nothing but rubbish ... until now `` incautos '' has been quite a surprise it 's a serious film with rhythm with a great cast and very entertaining the art of robbing that 's what `` incautos '' is about a film much alike to david mamet 's `` house of game '' and stuff like that a thousand of twists in the script and a story where nothing 's like it seems the weak points in latest bardem 's movie may be the so-american language that makes some of the characters look rather unnatural especially victoria abril 's she 's a hell of an actress but in `` incautos '' she looks a little bit forced ernesto alterio is not that bad but he 's not half as good actor as his father ... and what to say about luppi well he 's the man in short a good movie the best that miguel bardem has ever made i hope this is the beginning of a brand new stage in his career my rate 7/10,1
`` just before dawn `` is one of the best slasher films.it very realistic and atmospheric.it reminds me tobe hooper s `` the texas chainsaw massacre `` and `` deliverance `` .deborah benson very good plays the heroine and director jeff lieberman created very creepy and dark movie `` just before dawn `` is beautiful photographed and soundtrack is very disturbing.i never liked slasher films or gore except with this one.very impressive and convincing movie at least for me,1
i do n't even like watching those late night talk shows but i found this one really interesting i imagine it 's probably close to the truth -- -it `` feels '' like an honest account if that means anything kinda feel for the people somewhat when you watch it a nice movie for a saturday night,1
definitely not your typical polizia redneck just never worked for me the movie tells the story of a jewel heist gone wrong and a young boy who is inadvertently kidnapped in the process in their attempt to get away the robbers leave a bloody trail of death in their wake as they hatch a plan to ransom the boy the plan is never carried off as the robbers are more intent on getting to france and the boy is intent on staying with them while i could cite a number of problems i had with the movie i 'll focus on the most obvious  the character memphis played by telly savalas from his work in the dirty dozen and kelley 's heroes to other italian films like crime boss to his most remembered role as kojak savalas was a winner i 've always thought of him as one uber-cool customer unfortunately savalas is almost unwatchable in redneck did the director turn on the camera and instruct him to act as psychotic as possible it might not have been too bad had his actions been done within the context of a plot i cared about but here he seems to be acting bizarre for sake of being bizarre it 's appears to be random lunacy and what 's with that accent savalas might have been a lot of things but southern is n't one of them he sounds completely ridiculous even attempting the accent beyond that i found little of interest in the rest of the movie as i indicated the plot never drew me in i just did n't care about what was going on and the notion that the boy is so quickly attracted to the criminal lifestyle does n't ring true as for the other actors mark lester is almost as bad as savalas and the usually reliable franco nero is n't a whole lot better three `` name '' actors and not a good performance between them to make matters worse i believe the director filmed many of the night scenes with nothing more than the glow from his watch to light the shots i could n't tell what was going on characters i hate a plot i do n't care about and a production values that failed  little wonder i 've given redneck a 3/10,0
oooooh man was i pleased i did n't miss this i wanted to post this review as this episode in particular does what a certain recent movie did not it pays true homage to the game doom its plot is different yes and the characters are obviously set in an entirely different universe obviously the doctor who universe however the feel the pace the references and the location are perfect and for all original doom fans listen out for the door opening and closing sound effect it was the icing on the cake for me please all doctor who and doom fans alike check this one out its a gem,1
17/02/09 `` more '' 1969 dir barbet schroeder for a film that most viewers have agreed is pretty average i 'm impressed by quite how many differing interpretations have been offered of it i 've only scoured the web quite briefly and i 've already been informed that `` more '' is a 19th century-style romance an allusion to the story of icarus a plain film full of dull people and of interest only to pink floyd completists it 's fair to say then that critical reception is mixed i would argue that these wildly disparate readings of barbet schroeder 's 1969 directorial debut are proof enough that `` more '' is anything but a pretty average film neither is it a masterpiece of course i approached `` more '' as i did `` easy rider '' and antonioni 's `` blowup '' as a 'time-capsule film a snapshot of an era despite the differences in pace style and content between these movies they all have similar flaws either vague or downright unlikeable characters acting that seems slightly adrift from reality relaxed editing and abrupt endings that have left viewers indignant these movies never try to be persuasive or meet the audience half way they are what they are man this in itself is not a problem as long as we are left with a souvenir of the experience thankfully `` more '' offers several truly memorable images sounds and suggestions to the viewer and this is what saves it stefan is a young man who arrives in paris fresh from his studies in germany the first part of the film follows him as he falls in with a group of french hipsters accompanies them to devastatingly cool and self-conscious parties and bars before meeting estelle the two characters become sexually and romantically involved and he promises to follow her to ibiza against the advice of his friend charlie this is where the icarus thing comes into play she is the sun he is pursuing her you may now be able to guess how this all ends ibiza is an idyll so far away from the bustling urgency of the over-populated paris that the naive stefan knows he must be on to a good thing estelle remains elusive and erratic and the island has a less desirable underbelly up until now i had cared little for either of these characters and their unfocused pursuit of somewhere to be really free but once the action is pared down to just these two the film becomes poignant quite suddenly during just one single wistful exchange of dialogue in the remote villa they inhabit the place where their volatile love crystallises i went from watching with a fading optimism to being utterly enraptured i ca n't think of many other films that have done this the relationship between stefan and estelle is real and human in that we can see it go from life-defining intimacy to disillusionment and cruel coldness they take a lot of drugs and cavort naked on the terraces the rocks and beaches their lives revolve around nothing but each other and the beautiful mediterranean surroundings for a while their situation is the very essence of freedom emotional openness and experience for its own sake but stefan is not in control and this is the downfall of more than just his future on ibiza pink floyd 's score is a perfect fit for the exoticism the intimacy and the foreboding of `` more '' it is one of the most memorable inclusions along with the mosquito netting around estelle 's bed and their hallucinogenic exuberance around the windmill which appears on the soundtrack album 's front cover a scene in which they take acid to escape from heroin withdrawal is illustrative of the fundamental flaws of the couple they can not 'land without a crash maybe they 've come too close to what they wanted stefan never makes contact with any family or friends from before his arrival in paris we are left to presume they have no idea where he is while other 1960s counterculture movies dwell on debauchery excess the media and voyeurism schroeder has instead presented us with a story focused upon one man who backs himself into a little corner somewhere in the world and quietly disappears,1
an anonymous film which could have been directed by anyone at all.where is anthony mann the director of such classics as `` el cid '' `` the naked spur '' or `` the man from laramie '' there are marvelous shots of planes in the clouds lovingly filmed.the story is very trite and almost completely devoid of dramatization.the couple lives an almost routine life and the user who complains about june allyson 's choice for the wife imho totally misses the point.with her less-than-attractive look her hoarse voice she was the perfect housewife the screenplay needed.at the time women were barefoot and pregnant there 's not one single woman among the base staff even in the desk jobs -.all they had to do was worrying about their hubbies who were fighting for democracy and against an enemy whose name we never hear but in 1955 it was not hard to guess it one wonders why a young person who has never seen a mann movie should choose this one among all the great movies he made,0
i thought this was a beautiful film it is not my favourite of his films chungking express holds that spot this one is quite different from anything else i have seen of his it is slow but not annoyingly so it takes its time and ponders the characters .. there is minimal movement in the frame the camerawork is wonderful the acting is great the film feels like a long warm comforting drink,1
anyone who enjoyed this series when first broadcast i rushed home from school to see it now is of a certain age so i can only add my comments to those asking for a dvd release to enable those of us to relive the memories of first transmission before it simply becomes a piece of unremembered tv archive history if so many old tv series from the sixties and seventies can be released why not this surely the rights clearances ca n't be that difficult most of the shakespeare lines i can quote comes from this iconic series and i remember swapping them with my school chums as we tried to outdo each other 's memories of the text peter dews rightly deserved the credit for having the foresight to bring it to the screen this surely was public broadcasting at its finest robert hardy and sean connery fighting to the death it 's riveting stuff and from the beginning of the bbc television 's golden age come on bbc clear it and license it please march 2009 so finally the dvd is here and congratulations to those who have made it happen the picture quality is remarkably good and the performances every bit as good as the memory thought now all those who clamoured for it must buy it and relive those magic moments uk viewers given the series was made in the uk by the bbc using british actors it 's strange that the dvd release is not available there on region 2 europe dvd and can only be imported from the us and played on modified players it seems hardly likely that there are major rights issues perhaps the market was felt to be too small so why on earth was n't it released 'region free so everyone could enjoy it,1
this is probably one of the best thrillers i have ever seen it has action but not this bullet-flying good guys bad guys van damme stallone action but quick realistic and nervous action it has a plot cause till the very end of the movie you do n't know how this is gon na end it has characters aidan quinn donald sutherland and ben kingsley are just perfect and it has suspense this movie just wo n't let you go away before you 've seen the end of it though there are only a few characters i did n't find it difficult to keep my attention the the story and as for the story it 's basic not too tom clancy-difficult but simple and raw and realistic if you 're in for a movie with a good story some action and great acting watch this and i promise you wo n't go away till you 've seen the end of it the very end of it,1
the opening night for the 'south asian international film festival saiff in new york was an event a lot of us were waiting for i would finally get to watch 'hari om  i was tired of watching the `` promo '' on a loop and the lingering taste of the song angel by nitin sawhney in the promo left me begging to hear the rest of it i was impressed by the visuals and tremendously curious about how the rugged looking auto rickshaw driver would win the hearts of the stunning sophisticated looking french tourist i remember being rather intrigued by the theme when i 'd read a line or two about it in the papers ages ago especially so since i 'd personally been very fascinated a few years ago by how flamboyant the rickshaws in jodhpur were the snow and the crowds outside the theater only set my anxiety rising once inside the theater i found that the saiff organizers only presented disaster i was uncomfortable and embarrassed by how poorly the event was organized and found myself in a difficult spot trying to explain and offer excuses to my friends of mixed nationalities whom i 'd invited on the vip guest list i was hoping to prove to them that indian cinema was not always about bollywood eventually and finally the movie began sending some fresh air our way or so i thought hari om started with chaos and noise autorickshaws honking traffic and a whole lot of chaos i found myself smiling as i felt a sense of `` home '' filling up inside me thus began the journey of hari om an auto rickshaw driver in jaipur  the director could n't have made a better casting call with this character from monsoon wedding to hari om  vijay raaz despite his non-hero looks carries this movie solely on his acting skills and his take on the character replete with all the nuances of a rickshaw driver in rajasthan he 's a winner all the way but how and where he learnt to speak english even that fluently is the question however his character portrays beautiful shades of humor and sensitivity i love his innocent portrayal of a simple guy from a village who has big aspirations of being famous some day and yet knows when to cut away to reality camille on the other hand enters the movie wearing clothes that anyone would n't dare to wear in a place like that it 's funny however that no one seems to really care too much about her dressed like that she looks very very dazzling though especially in the latter half of the movie when she changes to indian attire her relationship with her boyfriend however seems very vague it probably adds to the touch of reality of certain kinds of relationships the movie takes us through the most beautiful parts of rajasthan the surprising part is that none of the places have been portrayed anything other than what they really are you see the dirt you see the primitive houses you see rajasthan exactly the way it is yet  there 's only one adjective that it leaves you with  'beautiful this is the first director who probably knows how to portray india exactly the way it is- with the dirt and the noise and all the negatives that india is attached to  yet making it look like one of the most beautiful places to be in kudos to him for that the only downside of the movie that i could possibly see is the pace i found it rather slow at certain parts  but rest assured that you will never be bored nitin sawhney 's background scores add a classy international yet very indian flavor to the movie the song `` angel '' which plays at a very crucial time in the movie blends beautifully with the visuals i 've also heard that besides the main characters all the other actors are actually just normal people who 'd never ever faced a camera before that 's commendable considering most of our so called established actors  still ca n't portray realistic characters on screen all in all watching this movie was a beautiful experience  it is a pot pourri of emotions it 's got romance humour realism beautiful visuals and locations ... great music a great cast  a package deal when i walked out of the theater i felt proud to be indian a few days later i asked one of my bulgarian friends who had watched the movie with me if he 'd want to watch another indian movie  and his response was  `` is it better than hari om if it is then i 'll go if not i think i 'll pass from now on hari om will be the benchmark for every indian movie that i see '' mr. bala are you reading,1
the youth in us is a pitch-perfect gem i saw this stunning short at this year 's 2005 sundance festival the story took me on a profoundly transforming journey the directing by joshua leonard the acting of kelli garner and lukas haas the art direction the cinematography the score -- every element was true to the bone one can only hope that this exquisite and excruciating film is prelude to more great work from this gifted director just as a short film is shown before a feature at sundance commercial movie theatres used a similar format in times past it would be wonderful if miniature masterpieces like the youth in us could reach a wider audience this way,1
no spoilers after hitchcock 's successful first american film rebecca based upon daphne dumarier 's lush novel of gothic romance and intrigue he returned to some of the more familiar themes of his early british period mistaken identity and espionage as the u.s. settled into world war ii and the large scale 'war effort of civilians building planes weaponry and other necessary militia the booming film entertainment business began turning out paranoid and often jingoistic thrillers with war time themes these thrillers often involved networks of deceptive and skilled operators at work in the shadows among the good law abiding citizens knowing the director was at home in this espionage genre producer jack skirball approached hitchcock about directing a property he owned that dealt with corruption war-time sabotage and a helpless hero thrust into a vortex of coincidence and mistaken identity the darker elements of the narrative and the sharp wit of literary maven dorothy parker during her brief stint in hollywood before returning to her bohemian roots in nyc who co-authored the script were a perfect match for hitchcock 's sensibilities this often neglected film tells the story of the unfortunate 25 year old barry kane robert cummings who while at work at a los angeles airplane factory meets new employee frank frye norman lloydd and moments later is framed for committing sabotage fleeing the authorities who do n't believe his far-fetched story he meets several characters on his way to soda city utah and finally new york city these memorable characters include a circus caravan with a car full of helpful 'freaks and a popular billboard model patricia martin priscilla lane who during the worst crisis of his life as well as national security he falls madly in love with of course in the land of hitchcock patricia kidnapped by the supposed saboteur barry falls for her captor thus adding romantic tension to the mix in good form for this outing hitchcock brews a national network of demure old ladies average joes and respectable businessmen who double as secret agent terrorists that harbor criminals pull guns and detonate bombs to keep things moving it 's a terrific plot that takes its time moving forward and once ignited culminates in one of hitchcock 's more memorable finales look for incredibly life like nyc tourist attractions all of which were recreated by art directors in hollywood due to the war-time 'shooting ban on public attractions while saboteur may not be one of hitchcock 's most well known films it 's a popular b-movie that is certainly solid and engaging with plenty of clever plot twists and as usual terrific hitchcock villains remember to look for hitchcock 's cameo appearance outside a drug store in the second half of the film hitchcock 's original cameo idea that was shot him fighting in sign language with his 'deaf wife was axed by the bureau of standards and practices who were afraid of offending the deaf,1
i ca n't knock this film too terribly because it 's obvious midway through the the watching of it that they were trying to make it bad or 'campy if you prefer anyway many of the parts they tried to make funny actually are but often simply for the cheese factor watch the 'space invaders game actually played as real-life scratch your head at the bumbling robots ... oh the wackyness and watch the whole thing go way over the top near the end with the 'time warp and the sexual innuendoes just keep on flying ... i 'm actually surprised this got away with a pg oh well a fun way to waste a couple hours but star wars/trek this ai n't folks 3 out of 10,0
the storyline of this movie is cliché and obviously has been ripped off from jurassic park the filmmakers did n't even try to hide that it seems as though there was not enough budget to make decent dinosaur-dolls so instead the viewer sees some robot-like toy-dinos from a cheap toystore which move in a very unnatural way it 's funny though because it 's so bad the acting is almost as unnatural as the dinos are no one seems really excited to be in this movie which i totally understand especially the last half hour is extremely boring and it 's almost impossible to watch it without falling asleep the one positive comment note i 'd like to make about `` raptor '' is that it does n't take a full 90 minutes,0
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job we have to support the emerging industry especially coming from up north it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs it 's a feel-good film and that 's how i felt when i came out of the cinema it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents the film has just opened i do hope it does well people should support this little film i think this 'vinny ... person is very bitter about something and getting too personal shame i say well done to all those involved have a drink on me i look forward to you next venture,1
where should i begin with this movie all i know is that it is a mess be the script story or the actors first of all this movie is very disappointing from salman khan who gave us a fun dulhan hum le jayenge and har dil jo pyar karega before this second rani is getting really annoying appearing in every stupid movie since kuch kuch hota hai glad saathiya stopped this nonsense the story is stolen from the wedding singer but ruins the funny movie the dialogues are lacking i may have laughed here and there but entertained no salman khan was tolerable in the above mentioned movies but here he is insane his character is poorly written one minute he is poor and next minute you wonder how is he poor rani mukherjee looks like a plain jain and was n't putting any effort she luckily redeemed her career with saathiya because her career was going haywire around this time pooja batra put a little charm here with her looks but it is still not enough jackie shroff is wasted kashmira shah 's beauty and acting has ran away from her because she chose such a horrible script raveena tandon looks beautiful but puts little performance mohnish behl gets the award for worst supporting actor they need razzie 's because there have been terrible movies in india he says stupid dialogues dances terribly looks weird and is not in his regular form just to tell you there is more to the cast who are also terrible if it were n't for raveena 's awesome beauty in aa meri life bana de i would n't give the movie a point otherwise the dancing by salman was terrible pooja batra was dancing like a wind in savariya otherwise i wish the costumes were given a make-over and the rest of the cast and their monkey dancing had been blown away from the wind the good song of the album was o priya o priya which does n't have a good enough picturization same goes for the half way decent title song otherwise this movie and the rest of the songs are a no-no for everyone,0
everyone knows the so-called plot so let me cut to the chase forced frivolity miscast performers working hard to have fun so you can have fun the brilliant meryl streep gives it a great try pierce brosnan just plain embarrassing inexplicably set on a greek island lots of squealing shrieking women lots it was a silly juke box musical on stage now it 's a big splashy poorly shot screen juke box musical if you like abba so-so if not an assault on the senses and an insult to whatever intelligence you 're left with when you exit the theater i readily admit that i did n't really want to see this movie and went with some friends who did but for the love of god why does my gender shriek and squeal to convey delight ever sit next to a table of women who have had too much to drink and are absolutely determined to have great night out on the town that 's the feeling of this whole project it just felt so good when it stopped,0
i remember that hey hey fuss i saw the jackson jive it was a pretty straight forward comedy skit but i saw this it is free is out in the clear have i missed something if the black community should be complaining about any racist comments in a tv show it should be this if you 've read my earlier comments i am not the easy-to-offend guy the basic plot is that an african/american moves in next to this white guy they make these racist comments like the value of a house will drop just because of black neighbours the white guy makes references like if your easily offended by racial slurs do not read on nig-nog jungle boy sambo i apologise but that really happens in this show i really am a guy who is fine with the black community people might say hey lighten up but even when you take the racial slurrs away it is un-funny no new jokes badly acted i can swear in one episode i saw someone 's eyes focus on something unconnected with the situation all in all horrible comedy,0
the film starts with promise because there is more interaction between spanky and buckwheat but as the film progresses the two boys have fewer scenes together this slows the pace considerably billie `` buckwheat '' thomas gives a very strong performance in his early scenes when he is left behind on the riverboat his fear and abandonment are palpable and his tears are truly heartbreaking when he goes from man to man asking for help and is repeatedly rejected the viewer really begins to wonder if this is a comedy or not watching a children 's birthday party through a picket fence is another moving moment as another reviewer mentioned i was also worried about the big dog choking on chicken bones once spanky and buckwheat are in marshall valiant 's home spanky tends to interact mainly with the adults and the chemistry of the children is essentially lost the old south/huck finn-type setting really does n't do much for the plot except allow the children to be out of doors a great deal ralph morgan is the most engaging adult but then the other roles really do n't have much substance to them louise beavers manages some funny moments with a yankee soldier towards the end the villains are n't really villainous enough and the lovers not intense enough yet i do think it 's worth viewing if you 're an our gang enthusiast if for no other reason that the odd curiosity of the whole piece i give it seven stars because while not a great movie it kept me engaged the whole time and curious as to what would happen next,1
this is the greatest movie ever if you have written it off with out ever seeing it you must give it a second try,1
this movie had very little good points the special effects and acting was horrible for sure but it was a movie made on a low budget so you dont expect much from it it does have some laughs i doubt they are intended though the scene where the old woman bends down and touches dung that was on the floor then puts it to her nose and goes chupacabra in a really stupid raspy voice was priceless all in all if you have nothing else to watch and just want to laugh at a really crappy flick trying to cash in on the blair witch project 's success then grab it other then that dont bother,0
after completing the lackluster novel heart of darkness i moved on to watch the movie which was a complete and absolute disappointment at the onset i expected that the movie would help put together the jigsaw puzzle of a book however even though i had read the novel the movie still made no sense at all so i ca n't imagine how lost i would be if i had skipped the book altogether it seemed as though the writers picked out their favorite parts and put them in the movie and left out anything that may assist the viewers in comprehending the meaningless plot this dreadful movie made no sense at all and i would strongly recommend against watching it as it will do nothing more than leave you completely baffled and bewildered,0
lets be realistic here this is one of the worst shows i have ever seen my wife and kids showed real promise in its first season and only went down hill after that it is so bad that words do not describe the acting and writing are so dreadful on a consistent basis i wonder if damon wayans was producing such an atrocious show on purpose from top to bottom every performance is ridiculous damon wayans completely phones it in and george gore ii is so horrible i cringe at every over-acted line can anyone really watch this show and find it to be entertaining let alone funny please i implore you do not watch this show as soon as tv affiliates stop picking this up in syndication we can finally be rid of this absolute garbage,0
this great film never showed up in my town so actually i did n't have any opportunity to watch it until the late 80'es when i caught it on german television i was expecting something of a disaster and found instead a well-acted grand western with superb location work the tiny tube could n't really damage it and there 's almost not a dull moment in this 4-hour film so i hope to see it once again on the big screen what a spectacle that would be do n't miss it if you ever have the chance unfortunately the harsh treatment of `` heaven 's gate '' at its opening ruined michael cimino 's career and he moved from the passable `` year of the dragon '' to the boringly ludicrous `` the sicilian '' and the screechingly dumb `` desperate hours '',1
ah batman returns is it possible to have a sequel to be almost as good as the original with batman returns it came pretty close we have terrific actors and a great plot with the dark knight and two new villains catwoman and the penguin we have michael keaton back as batman and he 's still awesome than ever michelle pfieffer the perfect choice for catwoman and was perfectly cast into place as much as i love and is such an incredible actress annette benning she could n't have been catwoman she does n't really have the look danny devito who could have imagined him as the penguin he was just great and terrifying batman returns with a more loving community of gotham city they are celebrating christmas time with max shrek played by a creepy christopher walken the perfect villain who mistreats his lovely secretary selina who happens to hear too much at his office causing him to push her out the window in hopes that she dies and will never reveal the information of knowing the penguin and the attempt to make him loved in gotham when she survives and is awakened by cats she wants revenge and is ready to go at it with her cats but there is also another active villain the penguin who is in search of his parents that abandoned him and now he is looking to be the new mayor of gotham city can batman be able to stop both super villains from creating their hanous acts and stop the mayor from destroying the city as well you 'll have to see batman returns is just as good as the original batman despite the first one remaining the true classic this one still takes you for a ride and come on i mean we 've got michelle in leather her classic moment of just meeting batman and the penguin `` meow '' is classic there are memorable characters lines and sets you 'll have a blast trust me 9/10,1
... not to waste your time watching this vanity project i 've had my comment deleted twice now for reasons that i have yet to understand other than the suspicion that someone involved with `` gone '' is n't happy with what i had to say so i 've pared things down to the nitty-gritty this time with an excerpt of my original comments that can in no way be taken as a personal attack on anyone nor unfair commentary `` '' gone '' is the sort of train wreck that gives new meaning to the words horrible stilted dialogue a script that just plain flails about like a fish out of water acting that would embarrass the most self-centered of community theater divas cinematography inspired by the `` survivor '' school of swooping crane shots followed by static nostril-exploring close-ups terrible adr work special visual effects that are n't pedestrian music that totally fails to sustain any mood or emotion terrible editing with utterly pointless freezes and fades no art direction to speak of -- -the litany of badness just goes on and on ... i felt genuinely cheated out of the time it took me to fast forward through most of it ... time that could have been better spent staring at a wall ... under no circumstances should anyone unfortunate enough to be reading this subject themselves to this `` movie '' because long before it 's over they will be wishing they had been `` raptured '' before they made that mistake '' case closed amen,0
eliza dushku is a very talented and beautiful actress she manages to be the rock-steady centre of `` tru calling '' but that 's not enough to rescue her tv series from mediocrity it 's a real shame that a woman as attractive and talented as dushku should go from a meaty supporting role in `` buffy the vampire slayer '' to this clunker unoriginal and desperately trying to be hip `` tru calling '' fails to excite on any level above hormonal the eponymous heroine spends a lot of her time running hither and yon across what must be a very small city in order to avert the deaths of good-looking corpses-to-be that she 's already met in the mortuary where she works despite all the running she does she always arrives looking like she 's just stepped out of a portable air-conditioned dressing room in every episode eliza dushku and the rest of the cast struggle to breath life into the bland characterless screenplays but it 's a pointless exercise `` tru calling '' just lies on the slab gazing lifelessly at the ceiling,0
naturally in a film who 's main themes are of mortality nostalgia and loss of innocence it is perhaps not surprising that it is rated more highly by older viewers than younger ones however there is a craftsmanship and completeness to the film which anyone can enjoy the pace is steady and constant the characters full and engaging the relationships and interactions natural showing that you do not need floods of tears to show emotion screams to show fear shouting to show dispute or violence to show anger naturally joyce 's short story lends the film a ready made structure as perfect as a polished diamond but the small changes huston makes such as the inclusion of the poem fit in neatly it is truly a masterpiece of tact subtlety and overwhelming beauty,1
i am still waiting for years a new dvd issue of this marvelous film i own a beta max recording with french language unfortunately mgm omits the french track on his recent dvd ... just english spoken an french subtitles ... i do n't know how make mgm to be advised i wrote emails to them but of course no answer if i insist it 's because exceptionally the dubbing track in french was spectacular funny well written etc ... george c. scott acting is always outstanding and for people born like me during the 50ies diana rigg represents something very different than madonna for example thanks for help ... kind regards ...,1
well now this strange movie it was listed as a comedy but i certainly found nothing to laugh at actually i am struggling to find anything positive to say about this film oh here i go alex ferns is not bad in the lead role and i did not pick the ending for a change but apart from that this has no great direction solidly two dimensional characters and is not funny enough to be a comedy or serious or dark enough to be any form of decent drama i would really avoid ever having to watch this movie again and think it does nothing to benefit any of the working class characters it is attempting to portray i found it hard to empathise for any of the characters and was not given enough information on the lead character jimmy to believe his motives best avoided,0
this is one of the most laughably bad films i 've ever seen i can not believe whoever wrote the review above was serious perhaps he was connected with making it it does n't have anything going for it there is no suspense the acting is dire the direction hopeless the music score is three trite notes played ad nauseam the plot must have taken all of five minutes to write the dialogue is what a 10-year-old would come up with if asked to do a homework project the only slightly redeeming feature is the actor playing the psycho himself who grimaces trembles and gurns magnificently and thus is amusing at times the only reason you would be on the edge of your seat would be if you were suffering from a weak bladder do n't waste your time,0
this movie is allegedly a comedy.so where did all the laughs go.did the forget to put them in on the version i watched.as a football movie it is mildly entertaining i guess.maybe 'm just a stick in the mud with no discernible sense of humour.or maybe this movie just is n't funny.it is also annoying with that way over the top `` you 're a winner '' musical score.and the odd thing is the team sucked through most of the season only winning the last two games and the last game meant nothing since they were not in the playoffs.so what is the point are they celebrating mediocrity i do n't see it.if anybody knows please let me know.anyway this movie is n't great or even very good.i 'm giving it a low 3,0
to me `` anatomie '' is certainly one of the better movies i have seen i do n't think `` anatomie '' was primarily intended to be a horror movie but a movie questioning the ethics of science if you watch it with that in mind it turns into a really good film the only annoying bit was the awful voice dubbing for the english version how can you expect any non-german person to listen to these unbearable german accents for two hours let native english speakers do the talking or use subtitles instead,1
this is supposed to be charlie 's masterpiece but i will contend that it is actually one of his weaker films first of all it 's not funny not one thing in this movie made me laugh okay there 's a quick jump into a box that was a giggle but that was one of desperation the tramp 's first and only talkie where he speaks he sings in an earlier film but his flat dialogue shows us exactly why he was such a joy to watch in `` modern times '' and `` gold rush '' two films that are at least ten times better than this film there 's literally only one good scene in this film the one where hitler plays with the globe like a beach ball that 's it okay so it gets a lot of praise for being the first film to wage war even long before we entered the war nope not true simply not true so that praise can be turned down a bit the three stooges did it on january 19 1940 with `` you natzy spy '' ten months earlier than the october release of chaplin 's film and that movie was actually funny if you want to watch chaplin 's greatest film watch this only for reference and then pop in `` modern times '' `` gold rush '' `` city lights '' `` limelight '' `` the kid '' or even `` tillie 's punctured romance '',0
perhaps it 's about time we declare 2007 to be `` the international year of the cinematic crocodile '' the ridiculous `` primeval '' came first about a croc named gustave ruling the swamps in burundi then there was `` lake placid 2 '' a low-profiled and made-for-tv sequel to a forgettable original thirdly there 's this incredibly derivative and soporific piece of aussie horror and finally i have yet to see the promising `` rogue '' the last one is likely to be the best considering the involvement of the upcoming aussie horror talent greg mclean `` wolf creek '' `` black water '' certainly is n't a complete waste of time and film but it 's another pretty pointless survival flick that confuses real-life agony with horror pardon my bluntness especially since i honestly feel sorry for the people who went through this ordeal but depicting three characters sitting in a tree and whining for more than a full hour is not my idea of sheer suspense three young people travel through northern australia and decide to spend a day of fishing in the remote swamp areas it does n't take too long before a gigantic and ferocious crocodile capsizes their little boat and devours the guide grace lee and adam barely manage to escape the reptile 's hungry teeth by climbing up a tree even though he remains unseen most of the time the croc patiently lies in waiting and makes it impossible for them to leave the swamp alive yes it does sound an awful lot like the plot of `` open water '' indeed replace the numerous unseen sharks with one giant unseen crocodile and the open sea with an equally inescapable aussie swamp and there you have it oh well `` black water '' at least features some rare moments of excitement and one impressively designed water monster it has to be said the croc looks fabulously groovy and you anxiously count down towards every next time he wildly emerges from the water the three-headed cast does whatever they can to keep their characters interesting but how do you achieve this by sitting in a tree the whole time the based-on-true-events concept obviously causes a number of restrictions like limited images of the fantastic filming locations dialogs and amiable character drawings,0
having lived in michigan 's upper peninsula 30 miles from escanaba in the mid-1990s i was eager to see this film it begins promisingly enough with some superficial understanding of the values and quirks of u.p life but jeff daniels apparently was not content with a low-key approach that would have been fitting given the place and the people instead he introduces extremely crude humor and some wildly inappropriate mystical/supernatural elements although there is a good movie to be made about this practically unknown region of the u.s. this is not it,0
the 1977 animated-live action hybrid version of gulliver 's travels or rather 'travel since he only gets as far as lilliput did n't get much of a release and it 's not too difficult to see why michel legrand comes up with some catchy tunes but they merely inspire lyricist don black to the likes of `` one simple fact remains/no-one here suffers from growing pains richard harris once again over-indulges in his passion for excessive makeup toning down the eyeliner for far too much foundation this time in an effort to hide the fact he 's at least 25 years too old for the role but at least he perhaps inappropriately reduces his larger-than-life tendencies for a performance made up mainly of patronising whispering the belgian animation looks only slightly better than early morning french children 's tv but peter hunt 's film is not nearly as bad as it sounds  the use of real model sets for the animated characters harks back to max and dave fleischer 's 1939 version while a couple of moments of swiftian satire do remain although it 's definitely aimed at the youngest of children,0
irene jacob is mesmerizing in this final installment of krzysztof kieslowski 's trilogy and the story is infinitely satisfying as it succeeds in tying all three films together i am simply in awe of the amount of talent it took to do one of these stories let alone all three everything seems to fit together so precisely all the elements of filmmaking so eloquently executed and the end result so much greater than the sum of the individual parts trois couleurs is epic in nature and belongs on any list of great cinematic achievements simply brilliant,1
if you are a fan of slap-stick that has terrible writing awful acting and cliche after cliche this one is for you there is far too much to list for the reasons why this movie sucks in a brief synopsis people with a combined iq of 100 journey to new mexico on a race for 200 million dollars and yes they are all apparently super heroes as they can do many things such as jump onto trains that are traveling 80+ mph survive numerous car crashes and endless instances of outright cartoonish roadrunner and coyote antics if you are a teen or dont want to think for a movie this one is for you .. not one actor outside of lovitz is believeable at all .. lovitz saves the movie from a 1 with the hitler bit 2/10 save yourself the 2 hours of pain and 4,0
hummmm ... another keystone comedy set in the park it seems that the number one location spot for shooting was in this same local park as so many of chaplin 's and arbuckle 's films are set there and while this is yet another one it is different enough and well made that i still enjoyed it fatty is interested in a younger than usual looking and acting mabel normand i think she 's supposed to be a little younger though in her mother 's eyes she is too young to be interested in men well fatty does not share her feelings and soon he and mabel run away for some innocent fun things get complicated when the mother 's watch is stolen fatty finds it and gives it to mabel as a gift ... and many problems result decent pacing and the fact that this movie did not rely too much on cheap slapstick but a reasonable plot make this a cute and enjoyable little film,1
this is not the best movie you might ever see but it still is very refreshing of course it has it 's flaws it has it 's humbling moments and yet at the same time it 's different from all the sh t you 're used to and is funny in a way only the french can give you this you might recognize a little from the masterpiece amelie when you see the opening i give it 7 out of 10 but still reccomend it to you if you 're tired of the usual bore you can rent in the videostore,1
this is the story of a news investigator who hates his job which prove why actors even as weak as tom cruise and denzel washington are on the big screen and your neighbors are not i 'll say this though the better moments show some basis for being really funny not just wacky to keep trying maybe taking some classes and using the time to keep learning how to make a good movie `` dude where 's my car '' and the `` scary movie '' sequence have it all over this ... college attempt the lighting was n't the production was n't and the script had moments the conversation from space very nice try unconvincingly executed this reminded me of `` dark star '' which is about being `` lost in space '' but this movie is just lost the talent was the bartender he said 'dog so annoyingly that i knew he had to be acting ... was n't he ... now that 's acting the mark hammond guy and marty i guess i gave the movie a point for each one of them ... 3/10 -ld ______________________________________________ my faith http //www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/,0
i saw this movie when it aired on the wb and fell in love with riley smith immediately i would recommend the movie to people of all ages who just feel like being entertained and not much more i wish they 'd air it again or cast riley smith in another movie,1
for a while it seemed like this show was on 24/7 then apparently there was a second season or some other kind of continuation of this horrible show about the two most vapid and conceited people who have ever been filmed all the other comments have captured the essence of these two selfish haggish airheads perfectly not much less can be said about them besides what everyone else has said i doubt these two ladies have souls and more than likely they made some kind of faustian bargain in order to get their lizardly snouts on a television series may the fates protect the human race from any more exposure to the ghastly girls,0
you 've got to be kidding this movie sucked for the sci-fi fans i would only recommend watching this only if you think armageddon was good,0
even a decade after `` frontline '' aired on the abc near as i can tell `` current affairs '' programmes are still using the same tricks over and over time after time `` today tonight '' and `` a current affair '' are seen to be hiding behind the facade of journalistic professionalism and yet they feed us nothing but tired stories about weight-loss and dodgy tradesmen shameless network promotions and pointless celebrity puff-pieces having often been subjected to that entertainment-less void between 'the simpsons at 6:00 pm and 'sale of the century or 'temptation at 7:00 pm i was all too aware of the little tricks that these shows would use to attract ratings fortunately four rising comedians  rob sitch jane kennedy santo cilauro and tom gleisner  were also all too aware of all this and they crafted their frustrations into one of the most wickedly-hilarious media satires you 'll ever see on television the four entertainers had already met with comedic success their previous most memorable television stint being on 'the late show the brilliant saturday night variety show which ran for two seasons from 1992-1993 and also featured fellow comedians mick molloy tony martin jason stephens and judith lucy `` frontline '' boasts an ensemble of colourful characters each with their own distinct and quirky personality the current-affairs show is headed by nicely-groomed mike moore rob sitch an ambitious pretentious dim-witted narcissist mike works under the delusion that the show is serving a vital role for society  he is always adamant that they `` maintain their journalistic integrity ''  and his executive producers have excelled into getting him to believe just that mike is basically a puppet to bring the news to the people occasionally he gets the inkling that he is being led along by the nose but usually this thought is stamped out via appeals to his vanity or promises of a promotion brooke vandenberg jane kennedy is the senior female reporter on the show she is constantly concerned about her looks and public profile and if the rumours are to be believed she has had a romantic liaison with just about every male celebrity in existence another equally amoral reporter marty di stasio is portrayed by tiriel mora who memorably played inept solicitor dennis denuto in the australian comedy classic 'the castle emma ward alison whyte is the line producer on the show and the single shining beacon of morality on the `` frontline '' set then there 's the highly-amusing weatherman geoffrey salter santo cilauro mike 's best friend and confidant geoff makes a living out of always agreeing with mike 's opinion and of laughing uproariously at his jokes before admitting that he does n't get them for each of the shows three seasons we are treated to a different ep executive producer brian thompson bruno lawrence who unfortunately passed away in 1995 runs the programme during season 1. he has a decent set of morals and is always civil to his employees and yet is more-than-willing to cast these aside in favour of high ratings sam murphy kevin j. wilson arrives on set in season 2 a hard-nosed smooth-talking producer who knows exactly how to string mike along the last episode of the second season when mike finally gets the better of him is a classic moment graeme `` prowsey '' prowse steve bisley ep for the third season is crude unpleasant and unashamedly sexist it 's therefore remarkable that you eventually come to like him with its cast of distinctive exaggerated characters `` frontline '' has a lot of fun satirising current-affairs programmes and their dubious methods for winning ratings many of the episodes were shot quickly and cheaply often implementing many plot ideas from recent real-life situations but this never really detracts from the show 's topicality ten years on celebrity cameos come in abundance with some of the most memorable appearances including pauline hanson don burke and jon english watch out for harry shearer 's hilarious appearance in the season 2 episode `` changing the face of current affairs '' playing larry hadges an american hired by the network to reform the show particularly in the third season i noticed that `` frontline '' boasted an extremely gritty form of black humour uncharacteristic for such a light-hearted comedy show genuinely funny moments are born from brooke being surreptitiously bribed into having an abortion murder by a crazed gunman and mike treacherously betraying his best friend 's hopes and dreams only to be told that he is a good friend the series final minute  minus an added-scene during the credits which was probably added just in case a fourth season was to be produced  was probably the greatest blackest ending to a comedy series that i 've yet seen below is listed a very tentative list of my top five favourite `` frontline '' episodes but make no mistake every single half-hour is absolutely hilarious and hard-hitting satire 1 `` the siege '' season 1 2 `` give 'em enough rope '' season 2 3 `` addicted to fame '' season 3 4 `` basic instincts '' season 2 5 `` add sex and stir '' season 1,1
excellent and highly under-rated from beginning to end one of oliver 's best well scripted directed shot acted and stuarts copeland 's soundtrack trivia the music during the end credits vaguely sounds like a late 90 's pop hit by `` spacehog '' band eric and cast are brilliant let alone the callers what a whirlwind of emotions it make 's your hair stand on end ... '' necks will be broke and whips will crack '' -- in a old female southern accent .. yike creepy scary than any horror movie 10 out of 10 em,1
this is a great story although there are some jimmy stewart cornball parts for the most part it is a compelling tale about an individual with a compelling drive vision and sense of adventure to say the least the bottom line is it is one of my favorites to watch and i 've done so probably dozens to times -- that is until someone stole it our of a bag i brefly left on a plane on a flight to california some have commented about too many flashbacks but i do n't know a better way to keep a long flight interesting for those of us who actually fly flight can be hours of boredom punctuated by moments of terror i would n't have wanted to see the flight shortened at all the oppressive need for sleep and the drone and surrounding loneliness is part of the story there are many parts that i particularly like including the takeoff from long island and landing at night in paris wow things have really changed with us and the french since then the airplane building scenes and the record-breaking flight from san diego are interesting as is the incident over the atlantic in ice which i understand is not completely true but did happen on the san diego flight one gets the sense that one of lindbergh 's biggest assets are his enlightened supporters as well as his persistence some of the lines that ring in my head now and then include `` pull the chocks '' on the takeoff scene and `` i hope i do n't have to use it that way '' when describing the submarine-like `` periscope '' to the lady who lent him a mirror so he could better see his overhead instruments this movie is not for everybody but it certainly is for me i hope they make it on dvd soon so i can replace my stolen version,1
i am a 58 year old man.on a rainy afternoon my wife suggested that we go see the women after reading the reviews i thought it might lead to an afternoon nap wrong- this movie held my interest from start to finish it was great to finally see meg ryan looking super again let 's face it meg looks much better with long hair annette benning looked different to me in every scene she was in candice bergen is showing her age as is carrie fisher the daughter molly was exceptionally acted by young india.i was able to understand the dialog which is tough in many current films due to rapid speech cloris leachman and the woman from finland were terrific as the housekeepers who extend their regular duties the nyc scenes were nice to see oh and bette midler had a short role but as usual was terrific so i gave this chick flick a 9. guys- go see this even just for the eye candy like eva mendes it wo n't disappoint,1
man this movie is awesome especially the part they show the italian chick damn shes incredibly hot shes not your average italian mna i would go see that movie over and over just to see that chick i really enjoyed the movie really hot girl shes steamy sexy also the actor are really good but the girl is better i think the actor played a better part in pride and prejudice so i do n't think he acted in his highest level but yeah back to the girl i mean shes gorgeous perfect and i could only wish her luck in her future movies yeah also her acting skills in such young age was awesome i was just amazed wit her performance what a great actress so yeah i recommend everybody this great movie,1
with its ww2 timing falling in and out of love and easy on the eye kira this is re-atonement this a relationship story with focused main characters working out the the balance between first and fast love in the home front of ww2 poet dylan thomas philanders his way between wife and ex in dark and smoky blitz london and later in windy wales vera 's ex and next spark off each other as the poet and soldier become a sideline while the girls bond and share an easy watch that works well in the era bouncing along with just a few dips in pace would work well with french subtitles but then i may have been to too many art house movies lately,1
say what you will about cinema 's `` wizard of gore '' herschell gordon lewis it must be conceded that from his first films 1963 's trashy `` blood feast '' and 1964 's crackerbarrel massacre `` two thousand maniacs '' to his last 1972 's `` the gore gore girls '' the man remained faithful to his muse gleefully chopping up the bodies of young men and women for the delectation of the camera in `` gore gore '' for example someone has been mutilating the pasty-faced and pasty-clad strippers at the tops bottoms club and obnoxious ex-detective gentry is hired by a hotty cub reporter to assist on the case the film features remarkably annoying and repetitive background music terrible lighting abysmal acting repugnant characters problematic sound and of course some of lewis patented gross-out scenes thus one of the strippers has her face shoved into boiling oil one has her head ripped open another has her face ironed and her nippies cut off and still another has her bum paddled with a meat tenderizer until her entire backside is covered with what appears to be buitoni tomato sauce i could be wrong here it might have been ragu the film also throws out some fairly lame humor although some of the lines are pretty funny for example we learn that the real name of slain stripper suzie creampuff was ... ethel creampuff a bottle of acid says `` made in poland '' on it do n't know why but i thought this was funny and some of strip club owner henny youngman 's lines are of course amusing still this is not the movie to show to aunt ethel or sister agatha it is one of the sickest you 'll ever see with only one surefire crowd-pleasing moment -- the title card at the film 's conclusion that reads `` we announce with pride this movie is over '',0
i am shocked to see that this movie has been given more than two stars by some people they must either be kidding or be totally blind for the art of acting directing and other flaws of the movie i must admit that i just could not force myself to sit through the whole movie it was just too bad the three first characters not including the `` digger '' were just awful actors and i mean awful maybe the director did n't care or may be he is a worse director it was like watching a bad school play the movie was of course filmed with a video camera lowbudget not real film and the light settings were not very good either in addition the sound man if they had one must either have been a newbie or a drunk as the sound were amateurish even in one of the first scenes from the kitchen awful acting btw the sound from the dialog was pretty bad for example when the woman moved her head while speaking you could hear her voice disappear and come back it sounded like they had tried to correct that in post-production by turning up the volume a bit when she turns her head in addition you had the ongoing irritating buzzing sound from either camera equipment or other sources in the kitchen all these squeakers in the first 5 minutes or so need i say more a good school project or fun project for friends to watch but should never have been released for a real audience especially not for a paying audience this was a rip off unless you have a very low standard regarding movies or just bad taste you are warned sb,0
large corporations vs. conscientious do good-ers we seem to witness events both real life and reel life of this sort all the time and most of the time greed wins by employing every means dirty necessary and the truth gets suppressed at least in this movie jack godell jack lemmon got his points across and paid for it dearly we have seen several more movies of this sort being made in the recent years the most memorable of which was 'the insider where russell crowe played a tobacco industry scientist who tried to blow the whistle claiming that the industry added more nicotine in cigarettes to make smokers addicted there was also this reporter-protagonist angle where the reporter is looking for the scoop of his/her dreams and the protagonist is faced with this moral dilemma where he/she has to choose between righteousness and his livelihood and sometimes his/her life jane fonda played reporter kimberly wells to perfection she plays a reporter who wishes to pursue serious news whereas her bosses value her more as an 'eye-candy she and her crew the cameraman played by post-'coma michael douglas who is also the producer of the movie witness an accident in a nuclear power plant while they were on a visit cameraman michael douglas sneakily/illegally gets footage of that event on tape in spite being a no-photography zone and smuggles it out of the station the station refuses to air it and informs the corporation that owns the nuclear station in the mean time the chief engineer jack godell launches an investigation of his own and discovers a lot of irregularities in the equipment that 's being used for the reactor this starts all the dirty politics of corruption and greed this is a good thriller and it managed to create a lot of tension in the audience till the end and the funny thing was that there was no background score to suggest all the scary moments now that 's great and unusual in movies performances were all good and i love jack lemmon we primarily know him for his comedic roles but he is equally good in dramatic roles i give this movie an 8/10,1
some spoilers a soap has some wonderful moments to recommend it when charlotte and veronica get close to intimacy is a beautiful low key truly erotic scene i also loved the music score and the soft muted cinematography i 'm not clear if the curious stop and start structure of the film comes from it being digested originally in serialized form the announcer describing the action in sections is quite annoying my biggest problem with this film is its rather absurd depiction of a transwomen and her life of course she has to be shown as a sexworker what else scatterbrained impractical absurdly frilly/girly completely hopeless when it comes to dressing and incapable of making any interpersonal attachments in the world moreover she 's always shown with two days growth of beard for some bizarre reason as if to emphasize how tawdry her life is and she 's waiting to get gender reassignment surgery when she seemingly has done nothing else to forward her transitioning in truth the character resembles a drag queen not someone in the midst of transitioning these are typical fantasies of people from the outside who really are n't connected to transpeople the film 's fetishization of grs surgery is a way of objectifying people who are going through transition not impressed with this aspect of the film in the least at the very least why not have the character played by someone who really is transgender ... i thought the male actor portraying veronica was okay but no better than that much better was the woman portraying charlotte a very complex character full of energy self-loathing desire and contradictions if she was so fascinated by someone with female energy a charlotte could go out to a women 's bar in two seconds and find it yes she was drawn to veronica but more as an abstract idea of someone with male/female characteristics a gentle touch but with a good punch not as a unique person yes what a soap says about love is often lovely and moving but that does n't mean an already stereotyped minority has to be stereotyped some more in the process this film also proves that danes are lousy dancers for such a promising premise better executed in a film like `` different for girls '' the final film is a letdown,0
this movie is great -- especially if you enjoy visual arts the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful the story is also both funny and poignant at times people who like european films and `` art movies '' will like this movie this is truly an art movie -- it actually has a lot of art in it go rent it,1
i originally watched this because i thought it was going to be the sequel to the league of extraordinary gentlemen and this movie is a whole different thing entirely going on here-a comedy however i loved it anyways the league of gentlemen is apparently some british tv series with some rather odd characters and some sharp humour this is british comedy so it revolves around being very silly dressing up in costumes and making lots of fun of germans and french homosexual references- in short it 's very very funny the plot revolves around the writers of the tv show deciding to cancel some of the characters and the characters coming out of their dimension into the writer 's dimension to stop that from happening it 's a fun twist and there 's plenty of great scenes in this idiotic adventure i laughed out loud numerous times and applauded the brazen style of humour this makes mr bean look like the watered down wimp he is rowan is much better in black adder series btw this is not monty python but you can never escape the comparison when you are talking british humour and there are a few similarities but not so many as to keep it from being it 's own thing and being fresh it leans more towards the young ones and guest house paradiso in its comedic style if you liked this check out the young ones series and guest house paradiso movie and of course i assume the tv series league of gentlemen must be rather funny as well,1
a lot about usa the movie can be summed up in its title it draws parallels between the attitudes of this country in the face of war and a kind of hollywood-like falseness that glorifies things that should n't be glorified i 'm not sure i agree with the filmmaker 's take on recent events although truthfully i ca n't always tell exactly where he stands but i admire the unusual and artistic way of getting the point across audio tracks of speeches radio interviews poetry etc play as large a role here as visuals most of the time the visuals of the story are accompanied by these audio elements to good effect i 'm kind of a radio buff so it was satisfying to hear the way that radio was integrated into the pace of the movie in fact most of the dialog takes place over the story rather than having characters talk to one another that 's not to say that there are n't `` characters '' real people but except for `` jim '' the protagonist a kind of '60 's drop out with an erratic state of mind the others come and go pretty quickly a few make a very powerful impression especially a guru-like taxi driver who seems to be the voice of wisdom itself when he breaks out into a spontaneous song of prayer while driving jim to the subway it is a very powerful moment on the cover of the dvd is the quote `` the danger is clear '' which is taken from president bush 's speech that paved the way to our incursion into iraq in retrospect hearing that speech at a climactic moment in the film brought home how we are living in a historically charged moment which will always be remembered,1
totally genius film from the cky crew ...... not the jackass boys ..... johnny knoxville chris pontius steve-o etc are not in this film ok so maybe they r not the best actors but its not what you call a serious film ...... but hey there havin fun and its totally funny to watch who does n't want to see don vito dressed as a roman emperor a total must if you like viva la bam or cky ............ an amazing soundtrack provided by the almighty him cky and others ...... check out the extra features on the dvd especially bran 's freestyle chinese rap number two ...... seriously hilarious ........... check this film out ........ you wont regret it ......... 10/10,1
disappointing comedy-drama with sentimental coating has michael j. fox ideally cast as a former child star who now runs a talent agency for thespian tots nathan lane and cyndi lauper are his assistants this all sounds as if it ca n't miss however too much of the scenario is given over to strident christina vidal as a streetwise tyke whom fox believes will be the next big thing they lock quickly lock heads and the bantering dialogue takes them back and forth to an uninteresting formula finish fox and lane are both appealing but the energy of the early scenes gives way to treacle slickly produced but ultimately stale 1/2 from,0
like the previous commentator on this film i too found myself in tears at times during this movie sometimes one wonders how a film of such awe-inspiring awfulness comes into existence from the first moment when our protagonist wakes up in his new york apartment from a dream of subway trains intercut with galloping horses what irish emigrant has n't had that one its clear we are in trouble and it does n't get much better whisked back to 1950s ireland we enter a world where everybody speaks without intonation and exclusively on the topic of the irish civil war schoolchildren go to school to learn about the civil war the drinkers in the pub divide themselves according to their civil war allegiances remembrances are carried out for those who died in the civil war the town is divided between those who believe we should remember and those who want to forget ... the civil war every glance and conversation is dripping with meaning that traces back to the civil war the blurb on the videocover of broken harvest suggests that the film is a parable of the troubles in modern ireland the only parallel which strikes me is that in present day dublin conversation is indeed dominated by one topic house prices if its intention is to offer some sort of insight into ireland 's obsession with its past it fails miserably it is striking how few irish films have dealt with the irish civil war and its legacies however it will take a film of a great deal more subtlety and intelligence than this one to tell us anything about the lasting effects of such a traumatic event on the nation 's psyche for those american viewers who have suggested the film evokes the atmosphere of 1950s ireland it does n't 1950s ireland was a horrible poverty stricken pit of sexual repression and misery from which young people fled in their droves however there was more than one topic of conversation,0
italian soft x exorcist clone woman buy statue of crucified thief said thief comes to life and turns out to be the devil with rape fantasies ivan rassimov plays the devil brilliantly mostly due to his gift of evil looks and because he was never above doing nudity good on him the actress in the lead did a decent job her wide eyed innocence and the fact that she looked great naked helped this one has a similar plot element to most italian horror films the girl 's parents are filthy rich and depraved watch it to get the details laura gemser 's husband gabriel tinti also appears as a random stud his part is basically phoned-in but like a cheap beer it did the job fault the director for its failings this could have been a horror/sex classic,1
i saw this title again on shemaroo i also asked my nephew who was 17 to watch the same with me i am 35 and he is 17. he liked it and i did too it still is funny a little childish a times but still very clean entertainment satish shah is hilarious in multiple roles this sitcom would still fare better than many of the recent serials on tv but obviously some people obviously like mundane fares that come out today it would have been nice that shafi inamdar would have continued for all the seasons he is no longer alive today i would wish if someone could list all the episodes here who can forget the lines `` yeh kya ho raha hai '' `` what a relief '' `` kaat daalu boss '' `` vyavhaar hai vyavhaar '' `` 30 years ka experience hai '' and the title track yeh jo hai zindagi teaching us to live the life as it comes and take enjoyment out of it the life of common people i still like this sitcom it may not seem as funny at times but certain episodes are still hilarious,1
assy mcgee is a show that you really have to be a certain age to appreciate otherwise it 's likely you 'll miss the references to 80 's cop films and simply think it 's a running gag about a walking rectum think it 's brainless infantile poop humor go watch the stallone film 'cobra and you 'll see what i mean this show actually has very subtle humor which says a lot both for a show that aired on adult swim and for a show about a walking ass all the standard genre clichés are in place that made movies like dirt harry and cobra so great and ripe for parody sanchez is assy 's partner who is as per the genre level-headed and constantly apologizing for his partner 's homicidal behavior the police chief is of course a fire-breathing hard case who lives to scream `` i want your badge on my desk first thing tomorrow morning '' the over-the-top and sometimes completely nonsensical manner in which the 1980 's 'renegade cop film is parodied suits the subject matter well for instance while breaking up a bus robbery one of the criminals stops to ask assy `` hey where are you going asshole '' to which the title character snaps off the one-liner `` i 'm going ... to shoot you '' highly recommended for anybody who loves 80 's action movies and has actually viewed enough of them to understand the humor,1
the worst film i have seen in the last 12 months the plot of the story was uninteresting the movie ended when he became gingesh khan i always thought there happened something really interesting afterwards i knew that mongolia and all the areas where the movie played have beautiful landscapes but the movie did n't profit from that the jokes where really poor the narrator gingesh himself could have told a bit more about mongolian history traditions etc my co-viewer knew nothing about that at all so he was a bit lost i was so looking forward to see this film but was really disappointed after all it was one out of 3 movies i have ever seen in cinema where i considered to leave before the end,0
i read the book before watching the movie and it left me emotionally drained but i felt that it truly transported me to afghanistan a culture i know very little about i had great hopes for this movie and it did not disappoint i watched this with someone who did n't read the book and he also enjoyed it they had to shorten some things in the movie but it was a well acted and well shot film it leaves you thinking about the movie long after it is over you feel for the characters and their plights i highly recommend this movie to those who like emotionally draining drama and want to experience afghani culture there are some disturbing scenes not suitable for children to watch it is a heavy drama depicting the horrors of life under a restrictive regime,1
there are so many positive reviews on return to me that my opinion is not necessary to encourage you to watch this movie however i feel the need to express my admiration for this unique movie bonnie hunt has proved that she is not only an exceptional actress but also a marvelous director and script writer this movie has everything and is full of humanity tenderness sense of humor ... do n't miss it do n't wait any longer and regarding the poor reviews do n't pay any attention some viewers forget that this type of movies have to be watched with your heart not only with your eyes if some viewers prefer notting hill or you 've got mail that 's their mistake for me return to me is a true gem an unforgettable movie,1
wow ... reading through these comments i see a remarkable socio-cultural clash theme emerging between the us and ... the dutch the us p.o.v appears to be that this is quite a good little movie parker being a likable hero the story a light-hearted rendition of what could be a glorified form of reality all three dutch reviewers view the world through a totally different pair of glasses it seems they categorically and in surprisingly similar terms agree the movie is a disaster far be it from me to take sides in what appears to be a dispute between cultures on this item as wide apart as the ocean that separates them geographically still based on factual observation i saw the movie with my very own eyes i suspect the dutch are not too far off the mark `` parker kane '' is poorly made utterly boring and really not worth the celluloid that was no doubt wasted in its creation,0
this is a fact that this is the 1st saudi feature film to be shown in cinema theaters but not in saudi arabia for a simple reason we do n't have cinema theaters in our large kingdom .. not only one cinema theater the government forbidden opening cinema theaters after the islamic extremists or the religious police or both asked for closing it in the late 1970s the early 1980s .. accusing the 7th art with encouraging wrong sex relationships and stuff like that .. i do n't see a powerful reason why we do n't open cinema theaters .. we have many videos stores throughout the kingdom we watch movies in the tv from some satellite channels we can install the `` showtime '' set channels and after all movies in general seems harmless in many ways .. i know many people how go to neighboring countries only to watch a couple of films .. i personally went to bahrain several times only to watch films in theaters because watching it there is big fun unlike watching a movie home saudis pay the most expensive cinema ticket in the world we travel to watch movies while the rest of the world have cinema theaters around every town this is one of the problems that we are having .. the movie is produced and presented by rotana filmed entertainment which is a major company belongs to the saudi tycoon-prince alwaleed bin talal the 8th richest man in the world the movie 's title is a word means literally `` how are you '' but it is also a slang means `` what 's up `` sometimes used as a slang to say `` bad '' about something and sometimes is used as a slang to tell someone politely to mind his business not to interfere in someone else 's affairs anyway i think they meant how are you what 's up in the same time i could be wrong though male actors are from saudi arabia like hisham abdulrahman who is very famous and has some popularity after winning 1st prize in arabian realty show more like `` american idol '' he works in some tv programs like the arabian version of `` cash taxi '' .. the other famous actor is khaled sami who is funny and has a very good sense of humor .. other actors like mishal al-mutairi turki al-yusuf and ali al sabea are less famous and they work on some tv series shows female actresses are non-saudis and they did a very good job speaking the saudi accent .. jordanian actress mais hamdan in leading role emeriti actress fatima al-hawsani .. not that we do n't have saudi actresses but are few and not that good a saudi critic `` rja al-mutairi '' who writes for alriyadh newspaper the most popular newspaper in the kingdom wrote about it saying `` lets not expect much of the 1st saudi feature film it was born in unusual circumstances therefore we ca n't judge it under the usual standards like any other film it is a fact that the movie hit a huge financial success in its 1st opening days only in kingdom of bahrain the movie is fresh and is about a saudi family deals interacts with controversial fresh issues inside the saudi society like women driving cars the low-shallow thoughts about the arts the guardianship of the society by a certain group the differences between being conservative and being an extremist the ideas are good but you feel you are lost in the middle of the movie one of the movie 's advantages is the beautiful music score by rajeh dawood which was good but sometimes it does n't match or express what 's in the picture turki al-yusuf did a great job .. his performance was the best alongside with mais hamdan .. the biggest loser is the leading actor hisham abdulrahman who came behind the supporting actors mishal al-mutairi ali al sabea and khaled sami who did a good job within the limits of their roles after all `` keif al-hal '' even with all of its disadvantages still an ok movie and it is a very good 1st step of rotana .. and the movie became the speech of people and streets which is a golden goal to make a strong debates inside the saudi society about movies in general until they become aware of the importance of the 7th art and other arts '' ps there is another saudi filmmaker `` abdullah almohaisen '' claims that he directed the 1st saudi movie titled `` shadows of silence '' i have n't seen the movie yet .. i hope i 've been helpful,0
ah classic comedy at the point in the movie where brains get messed together a two minute scene with bruce campbell beating himself up partially reminds me of how simplistic movies and ideas can grab you and wrap you into a whole movie for years and years bruce campbell knows what kind of movies we want out of him we want to see weird movies like bubba ho tep we want to see cameo roles in sam raimi movies and we want to see 'man with the screaming brain with the title alone one knows that it 's going to border that completely silly type of movie like army of darkness only with more silly and less monsters the idea of the movie is simple bruce sees doctor doctor has new idea bruce gets bad things happen to him on way to see doctor coincidentally it 's the thing the doctor wanted to show him that saves him hilarity ensues with the addition of ted raimi as a weird russian guy and journeyman stacy keach as dr. ivan ivanovich ivanov it 's funny that does this movie complete funny never a point of scary if you like the silly bruce campbell you 'll like this then again why would you be watching this if you did n't like bruce campbell,1
`` a minute to pray a second to die '' is a quality spaghetti western with a solid cast and an interesting storyline it is filmed beautifully with a relatively high production value for a film in this genre alex cord does a terrific job portraying clay mccord an outlaw who is suffering from increasingly debilitating seizures he is seeking amnesty before his enemies close in on him but is being too cocky for his own good when he asks for it robert ryan delivers the best performance in the film as the governor of new mexico mario brega and arthur kennedy are also great here this movie is very good but it does n't stand out to me as being one of the best spaghetti westerns out there it 's lacking too much in style to be in the same league as any of the great ones it does have some cool spaghetti overtones but overall it 's a bit too much like an american western this is especially evident in the music score which is ok as movies go in general but pretty dull by euro-western standards the soundtrack kind of reminds me of the music from `` the unforgiven '' although there is an interesting story here it is told in a manner which is a bit too conventional for my tastes if a spaghetti western fan and a hollywood western fan had to watch a movie together this one would be the perfect compromise all of this is not to say that anyone should avoid this film i did enjoy watching it very much as i said it is a very well-done film and i recommend it to anyone who likes westerns spaghetti or otherwise,1
some will say this movie is a guilty pleasure i loved this flick but i do n't feel guilty about it you can tell the whole cast and crew had fun making this movie but jack frost 2 wo n't go over well with some people right from the beginning you can tell this movie will be cheesy and it definitely has an amateurish look to it well if you get the privilege to watch this movie after watching it remember that jack frost 2 revenge of the mutant killer snowman is a pleasure not a guilty pleasure now because i ca n't fill up ten lines heres some great scenes spoilers the three women on the beach had great deaths the first one had jack in a tree trying to drop icicles on one of them he kept missing so he dropped an anvil on her the next woman fell on a bed of icicles the last one was stabbed in the eyes with tongs the other great one was where two surfers stoners are hanging out near a frozen pole one of them gets their tongue stuck on it of course jack frost pulls him back a rips his tongue off while saying `` cowa-tongue-a dude '' well you have to see it for yourself and of course the snowball children kicked ass end spoilers infinity stars,1
i 've seen worse which is a backhanded way of saying how crummy this film was the plot is ridiculous a student shoots a police officer and five more take him hostage in a dimly-lit smoky new york school -- and somehow this clichéd hostage situation takes 24 hours to resolve are you serious a day-long hostage situation -- with a wounded nypd officer no less takes all day i realize this film was made pre-9/11 but still i looked at the clock and wondered how they could possibly drag this overdone plot on for another hour and 10 minutes the acting was mediocre at best all-around and the characters were seemingly thought up by 7th graders the child-abuse kid the pregnant scared girl the violent gang wannabe a confused unfortunate victim the wise-cracking white guy please trying to make this hostage situation into a mission for `` more textbooks '' and better school conditions please -- this is a weak attempt to justify writing a movie about a kid who shoots a cop they 're confused ignorant idiots who get involved in a dumb -- far-fetched -- situation do n't try and paint them suddenly as noble the most laughable is ziggy who lives in the school 's attic and admires michaelangelo so much so that he paints these striking scenes on the walls you 've got to be kidding me the `` no racism '' signs in the protesting crowd a black kid shoots a black cop and a black negotiator tries to patch it all up this is a random message i understand the overall message which was poorly portrayed albeit by some actors who have gone on to respectable careers this was a joke though the red sniper lasers on the roof the worst scene was the kid fake snow falling dying in the arms of his buddy on the roof `` promise me '' etc how original the epilogue of `` i went to prison but now i 'm pre-law at xyz university '' ... a fitting way to end a joke of a movie,0
on their way to a country house to hear a new play being read a theatrical producer his secretary and the playwright end up stuck in the mud they make their way to a nearby house only to end up at the home of the playwright 's fiance if you ca n't guess that murder and mayhem are about to take place then you have n't been paying attention this is a a good entry in the old dark house genre not only does it have a good mystery you also have some very funny one liners wandering through it the cast is across the board excellent and they 're more than willing to have a good time with what is good material i would love to say that this is one of the best of the genre it should have been but for me something happened on the way that made me down grade the rating to only seven out of ten i ca n't tell you what it is not for certain anyway perhaps its the sense that i knew where it was going almost from the outset or perhaps its something else i 'm not sure what but there was something that i could n't shake that made me like this film despite wanting to love it it just missed being great and somehow fell short that said i do suggest you see it it is after all a very witty film that entertains fully despite just missing being great,1
this should have rocked vh1 moved away from the traditional divas whitney houston celine dion etc that had made the 2003 show so stale sadly the move backfired the show had no mc keeping the show together queen latifah did a fantastic show at the 2003 divas the show kicked of with a horrific rendition of lady marmalade featuring patti labelle cyndi lauper and jessica simpson okay in the studio with some control they can all sound great however when they are competing with each other why it just sounds torturous jessica simpson has the most bizarre facial expressions when she sings that i 've ever witnessed cyndi lauper also performed girl just wan na have fun that was n't as bad but it was hardly impressive the worst was yet to come cyndi and patti labelle teamed up to perform cyndi 's hit 'time after time it was acoustic and did n't fit in with the rest of the show still it could 've been okay if they both had n't insisted on squealing like mamed animals it was just dire debbie harry from blondie is always cool she has a style of her own and although maybe she ca n't compete vocally with a many of the divas although she certainly can sing very well debbie came out and performed blondie 's 1 hit 'rapture with some lovely vocals she really hit the notes perfectly she looked stunning rapper eve provided a new but sadly inferior rap it was good debbie 's next performance was a team-up with newcomer joss stone they performed the blondie hit 'one way or another i think joss misunderstood the style of the song and just shouted over debbie a rather sad bit was when debbie tried and failed to match her shouty style which spoiled it a bit she should 've just let joss get on with her totally inappropriate warballing the whole of blondie performed this track the final track debbie performed was blondie 's massive hit 'call me it was pretty poor not debbie 's fault because you just could n't hear her the sound was atrocious all the way through the show joss stone also performed a few songs on her own they were quite well done ashanti also showed up to perform two inexplicable cover versions firstly she did diana ross i 'm coming out and then chaka khan 's 'ai n't nobody she is not a diva she can sing to an extent but she has no presence whatsoever why not just get the real singers in chaka was even interviewed on the show .... gladys knight showed up and did a medley it was very good she was probably the best bit of the show i do n't know much about her other than she is a seasoned performer in las vegas and her experience and class really shone through patti labelle fitted in another performance this time her 80 's hit 'new attitude it was the finale and it was okay but it was too little to late this was one big dud better luck next time vh1 the version i saw was a heavily edited 55min version which was shown on vh1 in the uk if these were the best bits .....,0
i saw this film in a cinema-club in germany in 1970. most of the attendees were from the local private school at which i was teaching i had seen a few godard films previously while i lived in france and though they had n't been my favorites i could at least make sense of them being able to speak french helped the fairly innocuous beginning of `` le week-end '' soon turned into a kaleidoscope of images very well maybe too well photographed that soon made no sense to me for me films like books must have some clear sort of meaning this did n't for me i suppose i 'm not `` into '' artsy films images still haunt me from the film to this day i refuse to eat rabbit meat well-loved by the french those who 've seen the film might realize why yes the theme of materialism came through but the cannibalism the car wrecks and all the other scenes of destruction and horror only sickened me i 'm not sure if i walked out before the end but i certainly felt like it i promised myself that i 'd never watch another godard film and i have n't and never knowingly will my rating nothing it was the most disgusting film i 've ever seen others may have been more inept silly or stupid i 've forgotten those while scenes from this one will haunt me forever,0
for all the homicide junkies out there this movie was great every single character that ever was on the show made an appearance in the movie it helped to resolve some but not all issues from the series unfortunately unless you actually did watch the series most of the enjoyment would be lost as the movie made heavy references to every season of the show 's existence this probably would have been appropriate as a series finale as opposed to being a separate movie but we got ta take what we can get i hope they make more movies and continue to feature homicide characters on law and order,1
two hours ago i was watching this brilliant movie which overwhelmed me with its imprisoning photography it is quite understandable how it won the prize of best camera in cannes 2000. close ups predominated it close ups of walls humans and of many other things the warm colored lighting which is also usually by the director gave the movie a warm atmosphere only two persons are principally to be seen in most of it an interesting music and especially three songs or themes accompanied the movie nearly all the time each one of these themes represented a certain atmosphere during the whole movie silence and slow movements characterize the movie some scenes were extended moments or a serious of close-ups not only tony leung deserves a prize for his superb acting since maggie cheung was also so brilliant i wonder how many dresses she was wearing in the different scenes the story was also connected somehow with the history of hong kong and the region the 1960s this prevented me from understanding some details of the it especially at the end in short i would recommend the fans of artistic movies to watch it in the cinema,1
after seeing the film version of heart of darkness i feel as if i wasted 100 minutes of my life though the book was not my favorite i was very disappointed to see how poorly nicolas roeg portrayed the story despite the fact that he left out many bits of important information the cast just did not seem to fit their roles and the whole film seemed vastly emotionless the book depicts vivid scenery and detail that are completely disregarded in the movie you 'd think a director would be able to fit 76 pages of a book into a film of at least an hour and a half the differences completely changed the story for me for example when the character of kurtz 's fiancée is nonchalant to the fact that kurtz has died it completely modifies the ending the book had given not to mention the sets and scenery used in the film were not nearly as beautiful as they were described it sincerely feels as if roeg was filming another story with references from heart of darkness embedded in it if you watch the movie without knowing the title or expecting it to be anything like joseph conrad 's tale you may find it good though i thought the camera work was poor and the cast unfitting it is a captivating story all the same however if you are looking for a good movie version of the famous classic story do n't look for it in roeg 's film,0

in yet another miserable attempt to make a quick hollywood cash-in of one of televisions greatest masterpieces peter segal has created a monster taken out of context if one did not know brooks work before viewing the movie would be a lame big budget film that is n't sure if it wants to be fat joke and stupid comedy or just an ordinary action film with nothing to move on however as a young generation y'er who just recently spent two months obsessing over the five seasons of get smart the 60 's tv show this movie pained me from the moment i entered and saw steve carell dumbing down the part the backstories agent 99 getting plastic surgery and 86 as an analyst who was formerly morbidly obese shames the complexity of the original duo and paints a flat boring reevaluation of them it seems the screenwriters unable to be truthfully funny in both dialogue and situation fell back on lame set-ups for don adams famous lines flashbacks to fat camp references to carell 's part in the office in the interview style camera angles they have and a female chauvinism that falls flat on its face for those who have seen the original the writers of this movie thought they 'd include some memories they mention herbie fang now a worthless tiny furry dog that carell covets the shoe phone the cone of silence and his classic red car and the doors and phone that intro 'd the show the classic music is back but now everything is updated generally for the worse cone of silence is now some weird blue telekinetic force field control headquarters are right under a museum that preserves control 's past the movie lacks any creative random tech and replaces it with crossbows in swiss army knives lots of the `` humor '' in the movie is carrel hurting himself or another character being hurt whether it be carrel spending two minutes shooting himself accidentally with the crossbow or getting punched by security guards or throwing up in airplanes in the original smart would insult a big foe attack him with no success and try to buddy up with him before getting pulverized in this one he attacks without success and gets pummeled it seems the screenwriters did n't understand the humor was established with the dialogue and not the pointless violence it 's like they took the names from the show and cut out all that made it good in the first place the poster hides carell 's face beyond that of hathaway 's the movie likewise shies away from anything that could make it good they intertwine the classic music with the over-dramatic action and romantic music in big-budget films whereas the original fed off a campy feel this one replaces quality with massive doses of cgi explosions and pow sound effects i was really looking forward to this as i finished the original series just two months ago and it ranked in my top five shows of all time however this was a massive disappointment the credits say they collaborated with mel brooks and buck henry but in all the things i 've read on the internet they were largely left out of the writing process in conclusion if you want to waste your money on a cash-in with little value and no respect to its namesake go for it but be prepared that the ride is not how you remembered it ps i almost forgot the george bush humor they mention `` nuculor '' falling asleep at fine art president 's working for their vice pres and appreciating tackles over solving real problems if you 're into hearing the same jokes you heard 3-4 years ago in big budget movie form chuck your money here,0
i hate films about sports i guess the pre-fabricated hollywood sports film is a bit tough for me to swallow because it follows the most identical of ideas each year what i am trying to say is that there is n't much creativity in this genre use exhibit `` a ''  `` the game plan '' as evidence of this if you want so needless to say i was hesitant to watch this documentary because of the sports theme element but at the same time i could n't wait because i love surfing documentaries like `` step into liquid '' and `` billabong odyssey '' i took a step i plunged into the unknown and to be honest at first i was n't happy i did n't like the direction the people or the style that the film encompassed to present these young sport entrepreneurs with my first viewing i thought that history could n't be fully recorded so i thought stacy peralta was splicing stock footage with faux-actors acting like they were from the late 70s the music was intense it matched well peralta had made a mixed tape from this generation for our enjoyment but the visuals were anything but stimulating the elongated scenes while using amazing music to support just seemed flushed and too long for my attention i wanted to get to know the pioneers not just watch them skate for ten minutes in an empty pool i wanted a combination of who these kids were where they went during their rise of fame and where they are now it felt like i was watching the birth of our nation with a great score to the settlers just rowing their boats all day i wanted to know the men behind the myths then with a thought that i would have another negative review under my belt i watched the film again with peralta 's audio commentary his passion his voice his knowledge of the people and what he had to do to get this film accomplished `` wow-ed '' me this suddenly transformed into the film i wanted to see peralta lets us know more of where these kids are today what they are still doing and how difficult it was to get some of them onto the camera he had n't seen many of them in 20+ years so to hear these challenges brought the human element back to the surface he was sincere he was sympathetic yet he showed so much dedication to this project while i do not agree with everything that he chose to do i.e the sean penn mess up is not punk rock he revitalized this film for me it was due to this commentary that i rate this film much higher than originally thought jay adams tony alva jeff ho peggy oki wentzle ruml these are just a few of the name that need to be mentioned and continually praised if skateboarding is to continue the fast growing trend that it currently sees while tony hawk 's name sells products it is these guys these mild-mannered pavement slackers that redefined an entire sport sure others were probably doing it in the stone ages but these guys did it with style grace and moved it to the next level this was a hobby for them but it also propelled them in a direction i believe none of them were ready for `` dogtown and z-boys '' is the story of evolution being in the right place at the right time living in a generation without televisions to keep us planted and about friendship we have seen so many stories during the years that show the progression of humanity and this is definitely a story that should be added to that i can not say that i loved this film nor will i but it should be standard viewing for everyone learning or wanting to experience the growth of the skateboarding trend it was sad it was emotional and these guys are n't multi-millionaires over again  they are people with a passion and very rarely do you see that in documentaries overall i can not watch this film again but i will suggest it to friends and family time after time i think the downfall for this film to me was the filming  the attempts to be avant-garde with the style which ultimately drew away from the characters and events as mentioned before there were some elements that dragged on too much which left us with little to no time to know where these guys were now peralta obviously had a passion for this sport for the people but he seemed out-of-focus at times the music was intense and worked perfectly with the film sean penn while he was decent with his voice-over was n't needed at all they could have spent the money elsewhere on the positive the audio commentary captures everything that the regular film was missing peralta 's voice instead of penn 's brings a stronger human element to the scene while he tells us better stories of the people places and events watch this film but do n't expect to be blown away listen to the audio commentary i think you will be impressed grade ½ out of,1
this is a wonderful old fashioned christmas favorite which i try to catch on tv every year if i can it revolves around a martha stewart like journalist named elizabeth lane charmingly portrayed by barbara stanwyck however in contrast to martha this lady is a phony with no domestic skills whatsoever the other cast members effectively complete the story and include dennis morgan jefferson jones reginald gardiner john sloan and sydney greenstreet alexander yardley elizabeth lane is a journalist who writes food articles portraying herself as a happily married country homemaker with children in reality she is a single woman living in a new york city apartment and can not boil an egg her recipes are borrowed from her hungarian chef friend felix elizabeth gets away with her deception until the publisher of her magazine alexander yardley decides he wants a nice old fashioned country christmas and invites himself to visit her bringing with him a returning war hero jefferson jones a sailor who had been shipwrecked yardley demands total honesty of his employees to get out of her predicament and save her deception based career elizabeth borrows the connecticut country home of her longtime architect suitor john sloan a dull fussy chap who has long sought marriage she also borrows a neighbour 's baby actually several to pass off as her own and her 'husband sloan 's of course this scenario makes for much merriment it 's a screwball comedy and a charming romance with the added attraction of a christmas atmosphere whenever i think of this movie i picture the snowflakes falling the tree beautifully decorated the fire roaring in the hearth the turkey roasting and christmas cookies baking why did hollywood feel compelled to do a remake i understand there is a 1992 version directed by arnold schwarzenegger and starring dyan cannon kris kristofferson and tony curtis i have not seen this modern adaptation nor do i wish to this old favorite is perfect just the way it is and a holiday 'must see along with it 's a wonderful life white christmas miracle on 34th street and of course all the versions of a christmas carol,1
the film begins with a dandy gunfight where three bandits are quickly gunned down by a bounty hunter -- a bounty hunter who bears more than just a superficial to the man with no name from the clint eastwood trilogy fistful of dollars for a few dollars more and the good the bad and the ugly immediately after you see this man in a gold train filled with union soldiers naturally the shipment is attacked and the soldiers all fight like blind guys so they are quickly neutralized however in a twist one of the bandits cheats the gang leader gilbert roland and rides away with the gold soon roland catches up and is about to find out where the gold is hidden but just at that moment the army turns up and kills the traitor .... bummer however the man with no name wannabe thinks roland knows about the treasure and perhaps a medallion given to roland by the traitor holds the key a strange banker also is thrown into the mix all three want the gold and all three seem pretty macho overall this is not a particularly distinguished western much of it is the plot some of it is that george hilton a uruguayan despite the american sounding name is n't as interesting as eastwood or some of the other premier spaghetti western stars but most of it is because the soundtrack simply sucks so often the music does n't even come close to matching the acting and it seems almost randomly added plus it just is n't very good stuff as well this clearly is n't the work of ennio morricone -- music master of the spaghetti genre overall just a time passer -- and not a particularly good one to boot,0
if there were two parts that the physically towering ugly-charismatic actor gérard depardieu was born as a frenchman to play it must surely have been cyrano de bergerac and the orator georges danton here he dominates the film both through the breadth of his shoulders and the power of his voice his charisma carries the part despite the fact that it is made clear that the character has as much blood on his hands as any of the rest of them danton feasts while the people of paris starve ... but he is the one man who can challenge the tyranny imposed by the dreaded committee of public safety in the name of 'freedom and he is presented as the hero of the film -- despite the fact that the source play practically idolises his opponent robespierre for those who know the characters from history there is interest to be had in identifying the minor parts the frog-faced tallien couthon the cripple fouquier-tinville the tribunal 's prosecutor the dashing fop st-just the epic painter david but the script cuts little slack in this respect names are often late in coming if minor characters are identified at all and there is no hollywood-style 'info-dump to make sure that the audience can place events in their historical context the film takes it for granted that you know what has gone before and what will happen after -- sometimes it takes too much for granted as when it relies on a close knowledge of dates to provide the sting to its tail in the fact that robespierre followed danton shortly to the scaffold considered as a film it 's not entirely satisfactory in that it ebbs away towards the end the structure of the story leads up to some great confrontation between the protagonists in the courtroom or some dramatic climax to the trial which thanks to history never actually happens things just fizzle out there is no revolt there is no overthrow of tyranny there is no assumption of power by the victor there is no triumph on either side it may be historically accurate but it 's not entirely satisfying as the outcome of a screen scenario -- it seems an odd place to stop as others have commented it might have been more logical to take events up to the end of the terror and show in apposition the fall of robespierre,1
as an early representation of the turmoil of the 1960 's that followed diane arbus nicole kidman can be excused as an early flower child the film itself deserves no such latitude the lack of character development motivation and justification for the character 's behavior makes the movie very disappointing i sat watching and waiting for some explanation of the bizarre actions only to find that shainberg was letting me peek into a story that must have been someones inside joke that the few facts presented did not match diane arbus life very much did not help to clarify things either the washed out art direction in diane 's 'normal life was nicely contrasted with the brilliant colors in her 'awakening life with lionel and the trap door stairway was a nice demonstration of diane 's attempt to inject her new life into her existing family however i do n't see how that trap door in the ceiling of her dining room could directly connect to lionel 's apartment which was two flights of stairs up from her 's maybe my analysis is a little too literal in looking for some character development and relationship understanding that goes beyond one sentence or one comment i also would have liked to see at least one of diane 's photos as well i wo n't wait for the sequel,0
when one thinks of soviet cinema the propaganda masterpieces of eisenstein or the somber meditations of tarkovsky generally come to mind they 're great films sure but generally not the most entertaining material out there however the countries within the iron curtain apparently enjoyed their escapist musicals just as much as the states had in fact from the 1930s up until the 70s forty of these song-and-dance extravaganzas were released to much adoration by the public however they are completely unheard of in the west so this documentary attempts to rectify that situation it does a terrific job of both showcasing these films and putting them into the proper cultural context despite the fact i 've never been a fan of musicals i found this documentary to be completely compelling from beginning to end it goes to prove that no matter how many films you manage to see in your lifetime you 're only skimming the surface of whats out there as for the film clips themselves they 're very entertaining while some of the musicals are blatant propaganda showing workers singing of how much they love working under the regime some of the films particularly the later ones look quite accomplished from a production standpoint plus they are all extremely campy because of how alien they are to my western eyes there 's a few similarities between them and the american musicals i 'm used to but the presence of strict government enforcing of a message gives them a surreal edge they certainly do n't resemble the musicals made in the west this documentary is both one of the most bizarre and entertaining films i 've seen in recent memory and its an absolute must-see for any film buff 9/10,1
and 1/2 stars out of lifeforce is one of the strangest films i 've ever seen so ridiculous yet at the time it 's strangely compelling and never the least bit dull whether it 's due to the nonstop nudity the large amount of violence and action it all comes together to make an entertaining 2 hours of cinema the spaceshuttle churchill has been sent to investigate halley 's comet when they detect something hiding inside the coma of the giant rock a small team led by colonel carlsen steve railsback has been sent to search the area what they discover includes hundreds of frozen bat-like creatures and three nude and seemingly unconscious humanoid beings inside strange crystalline containers two male and one female mathilda may they decide to take all three back with them which results in a catastrophe when london receives no response from the crew another crew is sent to find out what 's going on when they dock with the churchill they find the remains of the crew all dessicated beyond recognition the humanoids are still in perfect condition and they take them back to london after various tests the scientists still do n't know what these beings really are then late one night a security guard in the compound feels compelled to enter the room the female is being held he touches her shoulder and she awakens stands up and smiles at him in a seductive and wicked manner she approaches him and begins to kiss him when it becomes clear that she 's actually taking his lifeforce sucking him of all of his energy the effect is slightly cheesy she escapes from the compound and begins to leave a trail behind another man colonel caine peter firth is brought in to track her down then the men discover that there is a pattern to the lifeforce process the corpse of the security guard awakens in 2 hours and takes the lifeforce of a doctor it seems in every 2 hours this process is repeated by a victim with the help of the churchill 's sole survivor carlsen they attempt to track the girl down before it 's too late lifeforce is pretty good late night entertainment it has all the elements one could look for in such a movie loads of nudity blood/gore and plenty of special effects this is certainly better than a similarly plotted film species thanks in large part to a more riveting finale the performances range from decent to terrible faring the worst is easily steve railsback who overacts to no end much better are peter firth who comes through and convincingly and the gorgeous mathilda may she 's as beautiful as french actresses sophie marceau and emmanuelle seigner may does go through virtually the whole role without wearing clothing and there were reports that it was hard on her while filming so the fact that she is able to go through every scene without fidgeting and looking uncomfortable is impressive there are times when she can be quite creepy being simply seductive most of the film manages to work because of her,1
this is the worst war movie i have ever seen possibly the worst ever made i find it incredible that some people have actually rated it as a 10. it has a stunning lack of even rudimentary traces of realism almost every war movie cliche appears in this film and is done badly on the other hand i would n't have watched it to the end if it had n't been so remarkably bad that it amused me,0
waste of 1h45 this nasty little film is one to avoid its like a cheap badly plotted cross between saw and a few other recent films about kidnap why the writer wrote this is obvious .. he has no soul and did it to try and me some money the twists were obvious when those in peril could escape they did the obvious and did n't etc .. only good thing about it is i 've discovered 1 new actress worth watching .. peyton list do n't watch shuttle though there are too many better nicer films to watch rather than this that will make you miserable and think less of the world spend your time more wisely watch good films do some exercise cook a nice meal .. anything but waste your time on rubbish like this,0
there 's nothing to say except i want my time back that this movie took from me i 'm not racist against latinos hell i 'm half brazilian i loved the movie kids it does n't make any sense these kids just go around and do nothing they 're not even good at skating the whole time i 'm just waiting for something anything to happen but it does n't nothing happens the whole movie did i mention they suck at skating i might make a movie called beat up rockers and the whole premise will be about kicking the sh t out of poser moron punks like these kids i 'm not even going to get into it this movie sucks please do yourself a favor and burn this movie if you come in contact with it so some other poor soul wo n't make the same mistake,0
i was surprised by how great black snake moan turned out to be.being a fan of christina ricci and samuel l. jackson id figure id give this a try.well when this was over i was just left stunned by how great this film truly was.i mean everything was dead-on great and very accurate for that matter.this film shows how the great director and writer craig brewer who made hustle flow another great film can just take anything even something that seems ludacras and make it into this.well i like how it is just a good time like its a film that just makes it there own in a good way.also i love that it does n't show big steroeypes of the south and how its been portrayed in things as the most repulsive place to be but not this film it makes very accurate and because of that very reconisable.the cating in this was just phenomenal especially from christina ricci who deserves an oscar for this role the always great samuel l. jackson and even justin timberlake did a great job as well.overall almost everything is great about this and while its not everyones type of film its definitely worth a viewing from anyone who can enjoy a good time three cheers for black snake moan 9.3 out of 10 stars,1
i used to work at the company that originally put out this film vestron pictures vestron had the same problem that a lot of small independent film companies had they did n't have a lot of money to put into the production values of their films not that money alone will buy you a good film look at kevin costner 's waterworld for instance sometimes if you have a talented person in-house doing the acquisitions or development you can create your own new talent but at vestron there was n't such a person and they always skimped in some crucial area in this case it was on the director and the writer which makes it pretty hard to have a decent movie even with the great ensemble cast this film has i think the basic premise of this movie was `` let 's put a bunch of quirky characters in a room and see if anything interesting happens '' it 's an intriguing idea but not worth your time watching most vestron films ended up having a very distinctive look and feel to them my wife and i developed the ability to spot this quality even in non-vestron films many times we were even able to spot that quality from watching only the trailer or tv ad we 'd sit there watching the trailer or ad and afterwards we 'd turn to each and almost in sync we 'd say `` now that 's a vestron movie '' this is a vestron movie,0
the odd thing about galaxina is not that it is supremely bad although it is the odd thing is that in spite of being supremely bad it is not funny supremely bad movies have their own particular brand of unintended humor -- the secret of their success you might say but galaxina is quite uniquely different -- it is mst3k 's worst nightmare a bad movie in which the intentional and the unintentional humor alike fall flat it is easy enough to figure out why the intentional jokes fail -- and the reasons are quite varied sometimes it 's a timing question sometimes it 's a good idea badly worked out the human restaurant could have been hilarious but it was n't sometimes it feels like there was some mixup in the cutting room with the punchline ending up on the floor and sometimes the jokes are just bad jokes bad movies get their laughs from such unintentional snafus it 's harder to figure out why galaxina does n't get any laughs on that count something is subtly wrong with the unintentional humor in this movie just as something is wrong not at all subtly with the intentional humor it is a supremely bad movie whose very badness is not the redeeming quality it usually is it 's absolutely unique in my experience,0
`` valley girl '' launched nicolas cage 's career and was an 80 's version of `` romeo and juliet '' it is a definite example of an 80 's teen classic nicolas cage deborah foreman and elizabeth daily all have brilliant portrayals in this movie but it will never top `` fast times at ridgemont high '' as the ultimate 80 's teen flick because if it were n't for `` fast times '' then the 80 's generation of teen flicks would just be a big blow to the head that 's for sure,1
perhaps the director was trying for another pirate good garland and kelly musical -- but this lame musical epoch falls flat sinatra and kathryn graysons voices do not blend well -- and their chemistry together lacks spark the premise of sinatra as a sweet guy who tries to impersonate his late `` bandito '' father is okay but he seems awkward in the role what 's amazing and wonderful here is how sinatra can take a rather insipid song and make it seem special -- his phrasing and eloquence as a singer make you want to hear it again when grayson sings the same songs it 's hard to believe she 's not singing something entirely different and not nearly as interesting she has her big moment with `` love is where you find it '' which suits her perfectly and shows off her abilities the photography is lucious and both stars look appealing as do the costumes and sets co-stars mildred natwick and j. carroll nash put lots of energy into making the impossible work aside from sinatra 's singing there is a strange menage-a-tois dance with ricardo montalban cyd charisse and ann miller it 's fascinating and weird montalban and charisse were a wonderful dancing team and this number is a real oddity,0
im a die hard dads army fan and nothing will ever change that i got all the tapes dvd 's and audiobooks and every time i watch/listen to them its brand new the film the film is a re run of certain episodes man and the hour enemy within the gates battle school and numerous others with a different edge introduction of a new general instead of captain square was a brilliant move especially when he would n't cash the cheque something that is rarely done now it follows through the early years of getting equipment and uniforms starting up and training all in all its a great film for a boring sunday afternoon two draw backs one is the germans bogus dodgy accents come one germans cant pronounced the letter `` w '' like us and two the casting of liz frazer instead of the familiar janet davis i like liz in other films like the carry ons but she does n't carry it correctly in this and janet davis would have been the better choice,1
this film was nothing more than exploitative gay cheesecake it was not an `` art '' movie just an excuse to show several gratuitous exploitative over-the-top scenes with extensive male genital nudity there was a locker room scene involving over a dozen naked men the camera zooms in on the men 's asses and penises as they are portrayed for several minutes with their dicks in full screen view there are several scenes in this film showing penis after penis it gets redundant real fast and makes it impossible to take this film seriously i was wondering if i was watching a playgirl video by mistake if these same scenes were filmed using women ex totally naked and showing their vaginas repeatedly it would be quickly dismissed as just softcore porn and an excuse to show a lot of eye candy ... which is all that this film is any artistic merit got flushed down the drain of the gay ghetto mentality the themes of class distinction homosexuality longing-desire etc were simple and superficial no more developed than what one would expect from a first year philosophy student just cut to the chase and rent a gay porn instead,0
i hope this group of film-makers never re-unites,0
david bryce 's comments nearby are exceptionally well written and informative as almost say everything i feel about darling lili this massive musical is so peculiar and over blown over produced and must have caused ruptures at paramount in 1970. it cost 22 million dollars that is simply irresponsible darling lili must have been greenlit from a board meeting that said `` hey we got that pink panther guy and that sound of music gal ... lets get this too '' and handed over a blank cheque the result is a hybrid of gigi zeppelin half a sixpence some mgm 40s song and dance numbers of a style daisies and boaters so hopelessly old fashioned as to be like musical porridge and mata hari dramatics the production is colossal lush breathtaking to view but the rest the ridiculous romance julie looking befuddled hudson already dead the mistimed comedy and the astoundingly boring songs deaden this spectacular film into being irritating lili is like a twee 1940s mega musical with some vulgar bits to spice it up star released the year before sadly crashed and now is being finally appreciated for the excellent film is genuinely is ... and andrews looks sublime mature especially in the last half hour ...... but lili is poppins and dolly frilly and i believe really killed off the mega musical binge of the 60s ..... and made andrews look like poppins again ... which i believe was not edwards intention paramount must have collectively fainted when they saw this and with another 20 million festering in catch 22 and 12 million in on a clear day and 25 million in paint your wagon .... they had a financial abyss of cleopatra proportions with 77 million tied into 4 films with very uncertain futures maybe they should have asked seer daisy gamble from on a clear day ...... lili was very popular on immediate first release in australia and ran in 70mm cinemas for months but it failed once out in the subs and the sticks and only ever surfaced after that on one night stands with on a clear day as a sunday night double thank god paramount had their simple 1million yes one million dollar film love story and that 4 million dollar gangster pic the godfather also ready to recover all the 77 million in just the next two years .... for just 5m .... incredible,0
despite all the hoopla about the trouble with tribbles episode the balance of terror might just be the best episode of the series and while i have always loved a piece of the action because it is so much fun i really do have to cast my vote as this romulan episode as being the very best the movie interestingly enough is really like a wwii submarine movie in that it bounces back and forth between the cloaked romulan ship and the enterprise as it seeks to destroy the romulans before they sneak back across the neutral zone after a raid on federation outposts in so many ways the show is much like the film the enemy below -- where the american captain robert mitchum and the german captain curt jurgens are shown in counter-point as they both try to outwit the other -- and in the process develop a grudging respect for their foe interestingly enough only a short bit of the beginning of the episode takes place on a planet -- and this is amazing because an episode on board ship could easily have been static and dull but because the writing was so fantastic and the main characters written and acted so well shatner and mark leonard as the romulan leader oddly for the die-hard trekkers out there they 'll recognize leonard as the same actor who later played spock 's father the bottom line is this is simply a great and extremely engaging episode that will keep you on the edge of your seat,1
now after watching the advent children twice the storyline is n't as shallow as majority has criticized it to be in my opinion if you have n't played ffvii or disliked it for whatever reason this movie is most likely not for you being familiar to the original story is a prerequisite to understanding ac fully otherwise you will just see the greatest cg animation in your life so far without actually spoiling the storyline i must admit that after seeing ac we have been putting pieces together with my friends relying on our knowledge of ffvii seeing it second time allowed to actually pay attention to the story more and most of the questions we may have had were answered some were not ac is clearly for ffvii players/fans and does n't honestly try to be anything else there is little to none realism in it outside ffvii world which serves the purpose music is mostly reconstructed ffvii themes with a heavier touch tbm team according to end credits and works well with the eye candy without exceptions i found the music enhancing the experience added to the visual fireworks in all situations we all know you ca n't put a ffvii in 1.5 hours and keeping that in mind the storyline actually offered more to me than i expected there are two issues at hand in ffvii ac and both stories were wrapped up very smoothly between the action sequences and trust me when i say there 's a lot of it action that is i 'm changing my vote from 9 to 10 after watching it the second time because i had missed a few explanatory sequences i could n't put together the first time that provided some answers as a warning it 's going to be easy to disregard the story and concentrate on graphics but try not to judge the adevent children because of that if you do n't let the story in it 's no wonder it seems sloppy i 'm not going to praise the graphics because i assume we all know they are awesome which might be an understatement especially characters talk so much more with their facial expressions than ever before i hope you pay attention to the storyline for it actually makes sense and works well with the whole get ready for the ride of your life there are no breaks,1
i chose this movie really for my husband-who works in radio broadcasting i thought that it would be more of a movie that he would enjoy and relate too though it was from the eighties-so it was a little dated this movie really draws you in at times you just want to strangle the host barry at times you just want to send some of the bigots who call in to a true concentration camp at times you really feel sorry for barry because he has truly gotten too big for his jeans if you know what i mean it was on the drama channel on encore-so i am thinking this is a true story if you truly love dramas you will love this even if you do n't know all the ins and outs of the broadcasting business if you are an alec baldwin fan and are watching it to see him you should n't his part is really a bit part in this movie,1
this 3 hour epic seems much shorter explores the will to power and conquest and the conflicting motives that underlie that quest by tracking two parallel lives the emperor q'in whose desire to unify the chinese feudal states has its basis in noble aims but devolves into violent oppression isolation and ultimate powerlessness and the assassin jing ke a mercenary killer who comes to recognize the unintended consequences of murder and finds a form of salvation as with all great art this can be understood on many levels the movie evoked for me images and ideas from homer euripides machiavelli shakespeare and freud the story itself is true i checked it out at britannica.com so this film will appeal to history buffs it 's ironic that q'in spent much of his last years in a futile quest for immortality not shown on the screen but consistent with the plot the movie can also be viewed as an allegory of maoism and the cultural revolution through the movie one can understand that the last 50 years of chinese history have had their precedent in the last 3000. fortunately for the audience these complex ideas are developed in a film that is rich in imagery action and pagent the battle scenes alone are worth the price of admission,1
one of my favorite movies of all times have seen it three times already it does a great job of summing up the isrelai walks of life israeli humor and seriousness and much of the problems israelis go through universal theme of wanting to be accepted and be accepted for who you are good subtle humor and it 's the charisma of the characters that makes this movie magic and says a lot about isrlaei culture and the irnonicness contradictions and humor with a great actor in it oshri cohen i highly recommend it to anyone and it 's a movie perfect for practically anyone family movie boyfriend/girlfriend movie and also says apart from israeli culture wanting to be accepted most of all how important family is with all its diversity and imperfections great great movie,1
this film derives from a long running itv sitcom by the same name.the sitcom lasted for half a decade roughly and brought to our screens rigsby phillip alan mrs jones vienna then in 1980 the film version hit the cinemas.now when it did sadly richard beckinsale had passed away was replaced by only when i laugh actor chris strauli i myself felt this gave the film a different feel.i would have preferred if it was n't shot as richard was a key character.thats like having the porridge film without godber or mackay the film did have some classics moments definitely but it felt a bit de-ja-vu many parts were seen before in the tv series now if you saw the movie first rather than the series you would get a different feeling about it then the series fan saying that leonard is definitely on top form and makes the movie just like in the tv series.the film has recently had a new lease of life on dvd and is usually on terrestrial over a quiet weekend.it is a cracking good film but for rigsby fans you may feel that youv e seen it similarly before saying that though its worth a buying/watching 7.8/10,0
starring kelsey grammar rob schneider lauren holly rip torn this movie is a classic family favorite at least for most members of my family that is one of us rolls our eyes at the mention of this movie and thinks `` what a stupid movie '' i 'm not that person though i still find this movie highly amusing i just watched it again last night with someone who had never seen it and i laughed just as hard as the first time i watched it it 's still very funny to me naval captain tom dodge grammar is a bit of a black sheep in the navy he 's the kind of guy who will play golf while on a sub cracking a ball onto a golf course while they sail past it he 's the kind of guy who will get drunk pass out and wake up with a hangover and a tattoo on his dongle he 's not the kind of guy that everybody wants to be commanding a sub but dodge is at the end of the line he 's put in applications to get command of his own sub several times and if he does n't get a sub this time he 's headed for a desk job meaning that 's it for naval life the admiralty decide to give him his own boat but they do n't give him a new nuclear sub they give him a diesel sub an ancient relic from world war ii his mission is to clean her up and take her out on the atlantic for a war game dodge is obviously a little bit frustrated to have such a crappy boat given to him when he 's worked so hard to get to the point that he 's at so he goes and talks to admiral winslow torn about it winslow explains the purpose of the war game diesel subs are still being sold out there in the real world to countries like iran iraq and libya to name a few winslow wants to know what would happen if some renegade captain in a diesel sub came to the states and tried to smuggle a nuclear warhead into one of the bases would they make it dodge and most of the admiralty do n't think so but winslow wants to know for sure hence why he has devised this war game dodge 's mission is to take the stingray out to sea then try to evade the u.s. nuclear navy and blow up the american naval bases in simulated battle of course so that 's about as deep as the plot gets this is not a plot driven movie it 's a stupid movie that is just a big gag it makes fun of itself and you are not expected to take it seriously if you 're looking for good dumb laughs on a friday night i 'd urge you to check it out bottom line 3 out of 4 worth a look,1
i 'm always surprised given that the famous title track of 2001 is called `` also sprach zarathustra '' that nobody nobody i 've read anyway has noted the parallels between the movie and nietzsche 's famous work `` also sprach zarathustra '' the idea of man 's rebirth into a star child an infant form of an indescribably more advanced being is an explicit part of n. 's `` zarathustra '' there is a prominent passage called `` on how a camel becomes a lion and a lion becomes a child '' in which n. describes the first incarnation of the overman as a child transcending both the ascetic altruistic side of man the camel always asking to bear more weight and the rapacious brutish will-to-power side of man the lion the fact that the song plays during the star child sequence can hardly be coincidence and also zarathustra said that `` man is a rope tied between beasts and the overman '' the structure of the movie fits that description a brief history of man as beast until we become truly man by mastering weapons and acquiring reason then a long sequence about man the rope as it were and then a brief glimpse of the overman the inscrutability of how these transformations occurred and the suggestion that an external force caused them is also nietzschean in `` zarathustra '' he makes it pretty clear that he does n't have a clue how people are going to be able to enact these changes themselves and suggests that we will have to depend on an outsider zarathustra to show us how to `` go under '' bowman 's psychedelic sequence at the near-end could be seen as kubrick 's best 1960's-style attempt at depicting the mystical `` going under '' i know these parallels are pretty broad and almost certainly have been noted elsewhere despite the fact that i have not personally seen it but i just wanted to mention them if for no other reason than to try to dispel the myth that nietzsche was ultimately a gloomy philosopher few people find the ending of 2001 to be gloomy and it is in my opinion explicitly and unmistakeably nietzschean the case could certainly be made that 2001 is above all a dramatization of `` zarathustra '' updated for the modern age feel free to disregard the outright snobbishness of my tying everything to nietzsche,1
boasting the title for the sickest film ever made pink flamingos is an undisputed classic sure the camerawork is shaky and off-center the story is muddled and slow-paced and every single character in the movie is repugnant and despicable but pink flamingos has a certain playful charm and brilliant satiric wit that no other movie can match while this film is indeed an offensive one reading descriptions of what goes on in the movie is much worse than actually seeing it only john waters can succeed in making rape murder sadism cannibalism coprophagia and just about every other form of human debauchery known to man seem absolutely hilarious this movie must be seen to be believed,1
spoilers more than likely ... nothing really important you could n't have figured out yourselves yeah it 's really weird i rented it at a blockbuster for the reason it had absolutely no description of the movie on the back of the box only a list of the bands that had songs in it but after that i had a dikens of a time finding it even here on imdb i kept confusing it with `` night of the demons '' but you know they 're basically the same thing the parts i loved most about this movie was the whole thing in the garage that black gym guy was hilarious the way he screamed all the time even when screaming was n't really necessary he 'd let out a `` listen up now block the door with cars '' and so they 'd run cars head on into other cars but then he got balls and shafted by a zombie with a broom stick i believe it was the other part that kinda caught my attention was the part with the crash outside the building with the guys that they girl did n't want to come over ... to what significant aspect of the movie did that give us what was it why was it there why did the movie end with a guy breaking the tv 's in a studio i saw that there was a zombie running towards the screen but he was kinda far away i mean he could have just turned the tv off yes this movie was shot on a whim and yes i hated it good day ...,0
first nick-623 pearl harbor was bombed in 1941 not 1942. they did n't have to predict the bombing second did nobody notice these six industrialist/lawyers/whatever were missing for a rather long amount of time they were killed before the surgery took place third how the heck did lugosi get out of cabs without being seen fourth why did the japanese not just kill him instead of putting him in jail with a convenient look-alike companion and his surgical kit fifth oh what 's the use this movie has a few interesting moments in it but by the time they explain what 's going on you 'll probably have stopped watching if not you wo n't care,0
this documentary is rife with problems how arrogant is it to make a documentary about your own family i understand you think the subject is interesting i was bored with it this is n't a fascinating story to me and i do n't know why you would think it was i do n't want to come off as mean but i have to say most of the people in this film are just not attractive and that 's ok not everyone is pretty but your camera technique to stick the lens in their face so you ca n't help but be overwhelmed by their unpleasant appearance because it is filling your 47 '' tv is not enjoyable i had to put my hand up half the time to shield myself from the warts wrinkles bags under eyes and yellow teeth really i 'm trying not to sound inhuman but pull the camera back so its not like total strangers are breathing in my face the camera work in this `` film '' is rank amateur level it 's the kind of camera work you see from everyone with a camcorder at a family picnic uninteresting framing unsteady even static shots are done carelessly put a little effort into it if you 're going to do this for a living i honestly ca n't see what the big deal is about this thing,0
a magazine columnist who writes about life on her farm house when in fact she lives in a ny apartment must come up with a plan when she learns that her publisher and a war hero will spend christmas with her after a slow start it turns into an entertaining little screwball comedy thanks to a fine cast in a big departure from her previous role as a femme fatale in `` double indemnity '' stanwyck displays a nice comedic flair morgan is smooth as the affable war hero while greenstreet is well cast as the publisher however sakall steals the film as a chef trying to master the english language while speaking with an almost incomprehensible european accent,1
with a humor that would appeal to an exclusive small audience the average viewer will find it pointless and monotonous when cartoon network advertised this show it was made to look as if it was a major drama or event complete with a real rain scene and government officials trying to catch the sheep when it came out on the air i was disappointed at how all the characters were so one-dimensional and a totally bland animation the only thing that put it to anything close to humor were the names of the characters like `` private public '' and `` general specific '' a few vague references to cultural aspects and how lady richington pummeled sheep with her steel wig slightly off topic but i do n't see why would sheep fall in love with that ball of dirty cotton balls called `` swanky '' it was hideous,0
i thought this movie was highly underrated the subject matter does seem like it would be a little strange and i was put off at first but once i was watching the movie it did n't seem strange at all i was intrigued with all the different possibilities that the story had to offer and i could n't wait to find out how it would end once it did end .... i thought about it for a long time after i was pleased with everything about k-pax from the acting and the story and the scientific elements and psychological issues to the ending it 's not an especially upbeat or happy film though it does make you chuckle from time to time but i found it to be especially entertaining and thought-provoking i own it now and intend to watch it many times,1
i had high hopes for this one until they changed the name to 'the shepherd border patrol the lamest movie name ever what was wrong with just 'the shepherd this is a by the numbers action flick that tips its hat at many classic van damme films there is a nice bit of action in a bar which reminded me of hard target and universal soldier but directed with no intensity or flair which is a shame there is one great line about 'being p ss drunk and carrying a rabbit and some ok action scenes let down by the cheapness of it all a lot of the times the dialogue does n't match the characters mouth and the stunt men fall down dead a split second before even being shot the end fight is one of the better van damme fights except the director tries to go a bit too john woo and fails also introducing flashbacks which no one really cares about just gets in the way of the action which is the whole point of a van damme film not good not bad just average generic action,0
eros and thanatos love and death command the dialectics of life by the end of 19th century in a remote japanese village a young man and a married woman older than he fall in love with each other and decide to kill her husband to be free to enjoy their love but they never enjoy that freedom since remorse begins to haunt them beginning as usual at the time by the weakest member of the couple the woman of course henceforth in an atmosphere where dream nightmare mixes up with reality the ghost of the murdered husband appears first to the woman but then also to the man it also haunts the dreams of the other villagers creating a climate of suspicion and gossip around the couple which is aggravated by the arrival of a police officer that comes to investigate the disappearance of the murdered husband but which makes this movie more interesting besides this almost common story of adultery is the evolution of the couple 's feelings in a shakespearean deep psychological and dramatic development of remorse anguish and fear which turns their love relationship into a nightmare until their final doom the expressionism so dear to japanese theatre or movie acting is also present in the players performances but not in an exaggerated form just only in the necessary measure to show more effectively the most deep feelings of the depicted characters this is indeed a solid good movie,1
this movie certainly is a weird one to say the least the basic plot is 3 old business associates invite 2 strangers into their home for returning a lost wallet with 10 bucks in it the two whom show up fall in love the 3 older business men die and come back as ghosts to try to help the two younger guests out okay so that may make sense but then we have 3 old guys whom apparently have some bread living together .. slightly weird here ... harry carey plays his part way off base you ca n't tell if he is a nice guy or really a prick i mean really make up my mind i can handle it then there is richard carlson playing james houston from texas .... hmmmmm he sounds way more like a southern gentleman from kentucky than a person from texas this one is n't even close .. then we take the 3 ghosts whom would stand a better chance of helping the new orleans saints win a play off game than actually helping out ... in fact they are really no help at all and why they are even in the film is beyond any scope of knowledge .. silly film in which a cast of characters act totally out of character .. you can avoid this one ..,0
this is a romantic albeit cheesy movie that is one of my all time favorites it is one of the many classics of the 80 's genre like `` pretty in pink '' or `` some kind of wonderful '' nic plays the traditional punk guy in love with the traditional valley preppy girl julie it is a heartwarming love story that makes you root for him to win the girl in the end true most of the acting sucks but ... i have been in love with nic since seeing this in the theaters and have seen nearly every movie he 's been in since he 's really grown as an actor but it is obvious in this early movie of his that he had a lot of potential if you love 80 's movies you will love this classic go rent it,1
felix is watching an actor rehearse his lines `` a ham a ham my kingdom for a ham sandwich '' the dramatic guy that tells felix he 'll `` have to sacrifice my art and go into the movies '' he 's in tears felix just looks at him like he 's nuts and shrugs his shoulders the old guy tells felix to `` go ye forth '' and find money to finance a trip to hollywood felix thinks `` how does he expect me to get the money '' in minutes of course this is a cartoon he spots a shoe business owner putting up a `` bankrupt '' sale on his store felix comes up with a plan to bail him out and the man promises the cat 500 if it works well it does but the man wants to go alone and leave felix at home in an outrageous scene felix transforms himself into a briefcase and that 's how he gets to hollywood transforming himself back to cat when they get there we then witness felix 's attempts at getting into show business his audition scenes are very funny especially with his imitation of charlie chaplin in addition there are caricatures of some famous silent film stars and executives in all quite a bit of material is in this 9.5- minute cartoon it 's amazing how much more you can get in an extra 2.5 minutes assuming most animated shorts are seven minutes in length at any rate there were a number of laughs in here and more zany things you could only see in a cartoon like felix have a sword duel with giant mosquitoes crazy stuff,1
i was skeptical before going to this because of the horribly assembled trailer which made it look like an equally horrible movie i was nicely surprised by how much i did not waste my money i believe the films success comes from how creepy it really is and how the environment of the house is little things like the sensor lights create a true uneasy feeling the shadows and ominously cold feeling of the house make it easy to tell that no matter how much you know horror films anything could happen in the film the acting is by no means perfect nor were they bad the main character is convincing even given the annoying teen dramas that surround her in the end i was thoroughly impressed with the film in most aspects it is definitely a film i would recommend,1
a satire about greed and money what there is more greed in the intentions behind this fiasco than in any of the themes they pathetically try to make fun of jim carrey 's reign was certainly short lived he is an unbearable presence on the screen the insincerity of his portrayal is nothing short of creepy he produced this this `` masterpiece '' as well so he ca n't blame anyone here `` the number one comedy in america '' shout the desperate tv adds of course jim carrey was suppose to guarantee full houses but the game is over if i sound angry is because i am i spent a sunny afternoon in california plus between tickets parking flat cokes etc almost 45 bucks on this thing starring and produced by mr carry not anymore do you hear not anymore,0
i ca n't comment on the accuracy of this production historical or literary but i can say that i enjoyed it if there is a god the sound track will be released ilona sekacz work is truly enduring twenty years on i am still moved by the haunting themes of this production and return to it frequently the story surrounds the entry into society of catherine moreland somewhat awkward and possessed of an unhealthy interest in gothic stories early pulp fiction catherine descends on bath in the company of mrs allen where she meets henry tilney she is invited to visit the tilneys at northanger abbey the seat of the formidable and somewhat financially challenged general tilney who has the unfortunate misconception that there is wealth afoot where mutual attraction mixes with family finance dispute is inevitable this coupled with catherines vivid imagination leads her to fear for her safety her eventual departure is marred by accusations and counter accusations of deception and connivance but the attraction between catherine and henry stands these trials he returns to provide a happy ending this final scene is especially compelling given the incidental music of ilona sekacz it may well be a `` bad '' production from the purists viewpoint gaudy costumes and shaky performances not withstanding but for me it 's 88 minutes of bliss,1
let me just say that granny was extremely well made with the horror violence and sure suspense moves the best indie horror movie i have ever seen that is only 58 minutes long ... it is my 5 out of 20 most favorite movie of all time you people should love this i give it a 10 out of 10,1
this film has the language the style and the attitude down ... plus greats rides from occy a world champ and the great jerry lopez john philbin as turtle has the surf pidgin down and the surfing scenes are still the best ever a true classic that can be seen many times nia peeples is a babe and laird hamilton shows the early stuff that has made him the world 's number one extreme surfer,0
going into the movie with the right expectations i somewhat liked this movie like most reviewers who have seen this movie i fully agree that the plot was razor thin clichéd and i could predict every plot twist from the very beginning of the movie but the dancing sequences were very well done and i really enjoyed the fusion of classical and hip-hop dance both which i enjoy watching the music/soundtrack of the movie was also very good which made the `` drama '' scenes more bearable the leads jenna dewan and channing tatum were ok as actors but their dancing throughout the movie was impressive and mesmerizing all in all a movie worth watching if you like to watch good dance sequences and this movie is much much much better than `` you got served '' in terms of the plot and drama then again that does n't say much does it =p,0
... the reason i like this movie so much is because of the spirit it has it 's a genial summer camp movie so the jokes are n't mean minded in a lasting way that makes one character the permanent butt of ridicule pranks do take place but you get the feeling that the respective fall-guys would be able to look back and laugh having been dopey enough to fall for them and without being too cheesy it 's actually kinda nice that everyone still remains friends in the end it 's an extra special bonus when the ringmaster of all these jolly japes is bill murray for me he 's still looked upon as the comedy god without peer when he gets a chance to cut loose no one 's better at generating a sense of freewheeling wacky anarchy without really hurting anyone the tone of the entire film has the same style as its leading man established with a great opening scene showing the murray way of getting ready for the day everything 's silly yes but more important than behaving like an adult is to have a whole lot of good-natured fun `` meatballs '' promises such and ultimately delivers a nourishing watch,1
this program is a favorite of our family and we feel it must be released on dvd by seasons the title of `` promised land '' is very apt as it is a positive statement about all the good that is left in this great country and the people who live in her it 's a `` god bless america '' type of program with inspiring stories old-fashioned values down-to-earth characters truthful and encouraging messages beautiful scenery and well-written humor and drama it 's a show the entire family is able to enjoy and benefit from -- without worrying about bad language `` adult '' themes crudeness violence etc we always felt blessed when we were done viewing an episode and ca n't wait to see each one all over again when they 're finally released on dvd,1
i have been a mario fan for as long as i can remember i have very fond memories of playing super mario world as a kid this game has brought back many of those memories while adding something new super mario galaxy is the latest installment in the amazing mario franchise there is much very different about this game from any other mario before it while still keeping intact the greatest elements of mario the first noticeable difference is that the story takes place in space the story begins much like any other mario game mario receives a letter from princess peach inviting him to a celebration at her castle in the mushroom kingdom upon arriving at peach 's castle mario finds bowser and his son bowser jr. attacking the castle with their airships bowser kidnaps princess peach and then lifts her castle up into space in the midst of the castle being lifted into space mario falls off and lands on an unknown planet mario is found by a talking star named luma and is taken back to the luma 's home a floating space station here mario meets many other lumas and also meets their leader a woman named rosalina rosalina tells mario that bowser has taken away the space station 's power stars and scattered them across the universe it is up to mario to help the lumas find them and save peach thus the adventure begins the way you play the game is by flying from the space station to other galaxies each galaxy consists of multiple planets that mario travels amongst in levels via these shooting stars to retrieve the power stars mario can at many times walk all the way around planets without losing gravity some planets are small and others are big many planets are similar to classic mario environments the best thing about the game are the controls all of the stuff like jumping and such is still the same but the wiimote is used in many unique ways in this game you shake the remote mario will perform a spin that is used as the primary attack in the game and it will as well activate the shooting stars you can also point the remote at the screen and use the pointer to fire star bits at enemies or objects in the environment then there is the graphics these are by far the best graphics on the wii it is just so hard to describe how great this game looks you could probably almost say it looks as good as some 360 games my only minor gripes is that the going upside down effect takes some getting used to and also the story is pretty weak the worst part is that you lose all of your lives when you turn off the game no matter how many you had when you last quit you restart at 4 lives still these minor problems aside it 's a superb game that is highly entertaining and is very challenging this is the type of game that we 've been waiting for on the wii a perfect 10 out of 10,1
totally disgusting and cheap bawdy humor i loved it it is the most disgusting and totally horribly acted film except for nicolas read who plays an un-dead court jester to comic brilliance but being that as it may i laughed so many times and i have to hand it to the film makers it was n't pretentious or ordinary in any way raping fighting zombies vomitting on their rape victims what other movie has this not for the quesy but with a pizza a bong and a six pack of beer you got it made if you have a cast iron stomach and a juvenille sense of humor like myself,1
i rented this movie without having heard or read anything about it what a shame this movie is intelligent witty hilarious fast-paced and realistically ridiculous the characters manage to get developed without relying too heavily on clichéd tired stereotypes it was refreshing to watch i could n't help thinking that marketing would have helped lob this not-so-mainstream movie into the starved-for-intelligent-comedy mainstream the quality of the dialogue and the ease with which the actors execute a huge range of awkwardness heartbreak and comedy is so rare these days -- i felt that the actors must have really enjoyed participating in something this rich how is it that national treasure was number one at the box office for three weeks in a row -- it is so weak in too many ways to mention i guess i 'm just happy that movies like `` seeing .. '' are still being made somewhere out there,1
captivating tale of backstabbing behind the curtains the movie follows the plight of david letterman and jay leno as they struggle for the elusive tonight show spot letterman led by his desire for the coveted time slot and leno led by his agent and little-devil-on-the-shoulder helen kushnick kathy bates kushnick is excellent in this movie alienating herself from such top dogs as bob wright warren littlefield and howard stringer towards the end of the film you are so entranced with how she handles every situation from guest bookings to delayed taping that you find yourself wanting more john michael higgins letterman plays his part to the tee at times i found myself wondering if he was any relation to the real letterman i highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in entertainment or the world of corporate negotiations,1
i hesitated seeing this movie having really enjoyed the original 'mostly martha what a disappointment catherine zeta jones is a good actress but this was n't her film the original had poignant moments perfectly punctuated with an incredible soundtrack no reservations felt like it never connected the food the characters nothing felt passionate in mostly martha the food came alive- every scene was filmed in such a way you could taste it with your eyes the smells the textures the food in 'no reservations was in the background rarely did we get a closeup of the preparation the characters were not real enough to carry the movie without it it was hard finishing the movie many of the scenes felt awkward see the original it 's a truly enjoyable movie the soundtrack incredible,0
the problem with this series is that it is too real i am watching it on amazon `` unbox '' and having just finished episode 2 i hate absolutely hate fark the leader of the cell i can not recall any television series ever having this emotional impact remember the old tag line for horror movies `` just keep telling yourself its only a movie '' well i find myself repeatedly reminding myself that its `` only tv '' but of course it is n't only tv is it the possibility of a cell such as the one portrayed here actually operating in the united states is certainly within the range of plausibility that 's what gives this program its vicious authenticity and that 's why i hate it so much,1
i have been a `` huge '' rush fan ever since `` moving pictures '' and this concert is simply and example to everyone who is a fan why rush is so popular they completely admitted to playing their biggest concert yet and despite the rain in a soccer arena they still manage to give an outstanding performance from start to finish a real example of this is during `` yyz '' the entire crowd start to sing along to it in a real classic manner in perfect sinc they really play all of everyone 's favorite songs with a real powerful `` lust '' that rarely happens anymore you get the best seat in the house for one of their best concerts given the second dvd is a fascinating documentary of the band while they are in brazil and shows you a lot of the backstage things going on and it allows you to see them not just a musicians but as actual people in their everyday life this dvd gift set is a must for any rush fan young and old and is definitely a keeper for your dvd collection their is even a cd of the concert for those who just want to listen to the music this dvd is worth it,1
after watch this movie i was surprised that someone had like it i think this is the worst comedy i ever seen .... ever if you think you had already seen the worst comedy made wait for watch this crap not funny at all ok one or two laugh maybe ....... but you have to be really high the acting is terrible and the story does n't exist even if you like snowboarding and i really do you will hate this movie ok ok you can see some nice babes some nice snowboarding tricks and some beautiful mountains but that 's all watch a porno set in the mountains instead because the acting and the story line might be better sometimes in imdb i read bad review about some movie and at the end they are not so awful .... but this one believe me is pure trash do n't waste your time and money in this one,0
ik know it is impossible to keep all details of a book in a movie but this movie has changed nearly everything without any reason furthermore many changes have made the story illogical a few examples 1 in the movie `` paul renauld '' really meets poriot before he dies in the book poirot only gets a letter telling him he is afraid to be killed this is completely stupid because if renaulds plan would have succeeded poirot would have known that the dead man would not have been renauld poirot was in the morgue when mrs renauld identified the victim 2 the movie has `` combined '' two persons into one `` cinderella '' has been removed by the movie the girl hastings falls in love with and the ex-girlfriend of jack renauld are one person in the movie why for god 's sake 3 hastings finds the victims cause he is such a bad golf player totally unfunny and stupid 4 the movie tells secrets much too early for example at the very beginning so you know things you should n't know 5 the murderer gets shot at the end by a person who does n't exists in the book perhaps because the person `` cinderella '' who stops the murderer does not exists in the movie 6 the book is very complex the movie takes only about 90 minutes sure it is difficult to include all the necessary details but it is impossible if you include stupid things which were not in the book and have no meaning e.g bicycle race,0
`` radio flyer '' is one of my most loved american movies the really great job of two boys joe mazzello and elija wood in spite of terrible performance of t.hanks at the beginning and ending ... with marvellous script of d.m.evans and powerful and emotional directing of r.donner plus absolutely incredibly peerless music score of h.zimmer allowed the `` radio flyer '' to win one of the first places in my family 's rating of movies it 's so pity that that very good movie was underrating by some movie critics i just ca n't help waiting to see it on dvd,1
as salinger 's `` a perfect day for bananafish '' ends with the suicide of a prodigy this movie opens with the death of the star high school swimmer legend matt who shoots himself in the head with a revolver after in the opening scene but the death of matt travis serves as a key to unlock the door of another prodigy his brother tim who never in his life seriously bothered with the question `` what am i going to do '' when he finds his brother dead his head broken like a dropped watermelon the travis family starts vomiting out its secrets one by one the film focuses on tim he is a victim of bullying domestic abuse family alienation heartbreak issues of sexuality and friendship tim reveals his wounds by physical bruises but these are not the only injuries to his person as we slowly come to realize as the script painfully unveils the origins and outcome of tim scars everyone who loves him hurts him hirsch plays out the character quite well revealing frame after frame in the visual expression of his body a host of conflicting emotions inside the soul of a kid whom no one seems to listen to or know very well unknowing and unaware of his depth of soul and prodigious talent two siblings sharing a doobie curled up on a red spinnable playground saucer tim asks penny `` what am i going to do with the rest of my life '' the scene is framed in a familiar recurring image of the film the comfortable playground where tim obviously feels at home filmed from a bird 's eye view because with every character tim feels comfortable to share a part of himself and we view these intimate moments he shares in the red spinnable playground saucer complete with childish graffiti carved in pencil from above after advising him curtly to pass the joint penny tells him `` tim well the secret to the success of life is to find something you love and you have to do that for the rest of your life and you better hope to hell that you 're good at it because if you 're not then you 'll probably fail '' this simple line of advice from penny serves as the movie 's central theme the responsibility of talent and the possibility of failure why does one person have a talent he can not stand like matt who hated the attention his swimming fame brought but no one notices tim 's talent  no one  because no one bothers to ask him not even us the film makes us aware that we ourselves do not know tim as well as we thought we did when we first meet this handsome sad guy in our intimate understanding of tim as it progresses we are reminded that not everyone is as they seem to be this is the other side of the film the failure of those who should  parents friends teachers  whoever  to notice and see the gifts of the people they claim to love not even his mother sandy played by sigourney weaver sees tim 's gift despite her love for her son weaver does a deft job of a middle-aged woman grappling with her own inner demons as she haphazardly tries to play the roles of domesticity and support when tim is found to be bullied at school she storms the boy 's trailer threatening his life `` you can tease torture punch drive drunk with me i can forgive you hell i can understand it i 'm a good christian you know i can forgive and forget but you mess with my kid and may god himself descend from heaven to protect you because as long as i live  and i will outlive you all  i will wake up and go to sleep at night just dreaming of ways to make your petty insignificant lives into hell on earth '' after flicking a paper cup into the mother 's face she looks around the trailer and looking at them both the kid and his stunned mother comments `` nice trailer '' and leaves as quickly as she came weaver scores in her ability to match gusto with visceral wit that is acid and witty and tim 's father played by jeff daniels is blind to who his son is treating him like a stranger not telling his family that he took time off from the office spending his days in the city park listless a carved out soul and sleeping in matt 's bed tucked in with his high school letter jacket jeff daniels does a superb job of making us believe that he can be both a bastard and lovable because we grow to see that even an inept father can show his love for his son in an emotional scene tim confronts his father just when you think his dad is going to hit him he grabs for him to embrace him not letting him go he tells tim `` i am your father and you 're are my son and i 'm here okay but you 've got ta talk to me i do n't know how to do this by myself '' it is here at this moment in the film that a father tells his son you have to tell me what 's going on inside of you you have to tell me who you are i want to know who you are it is in this scene that the film reaches a cathartic moment the visual movement from tim angry and alone to his father embracing him as he breaks downs and weeps revealing the emotions hidden beneath his shell tim experiences this moment of cleansing with his dad as a catharsis especially when you consider the mistreatment manipulation disregard violence and betrayal he has been dealt in the long year the film encompasses i recommend this film,1
this is so bad i do n't know where to begin the lead role is a good starting point it is a supreme mary sue character that has few things in common with the original one from the book who was a bit more credible no this one is invincible infallible indomitable and insipid even beyond the overinflated standards that this `` chicks with swords '' era that our medias are spinning out of late she is a twenty-something top-model thin as a match yet rich already a leader in her academic field a kung-fu master a natural sniper and seems to have enough authority to naturally trump anyone official like puny fbi agents she is god to balance it out she is supposed to be socially awkward due to her typically harsh upbringing that transformed her into a `` spock '' which gives us some delighted moments where she wonders what is `` star wars '' or `` american idol '' but yet when it 's really important she can conveniently reveal herself as a top negotiator and diplomat because she is so superior ya know to top it out she is played by a wooden actress the more talented boreanaz serves as a faire-valoir token for this construct acting as a bumbling comic-relief and house `` watson '' in fact everything in there is a pop-parody of better works like sherlock holmes csi and x-files from which it tries to emulate the sexual tension between main protagonists it is however cheaper as this is delivered with all the subtlety of an elbow poke in the ribs but a million million poor factory girls will doubtlessly buy into it hence the crazy rating this turkey gets in fact the lowest common denominator goes a long way in this sad puppy resulting in titillating sex details from the legion of sidekicks that aim to pass it out as daring and trendy while the overall tone of the show carries an obvious neo-conservative view on things story-wise there 's not much here to feast upon as crimes that always start out with some gruesome remains are resolved using non-existent technology while the `` squints '' lovable but so wrong the women less than the guys goes on varied theories all of them futile as the main character has it all from the start and once it is established she goes out and then punch the guy typically a real tough hombre with a spin kick here and a slapper there the end,0
i do n't know about the english version of this movie but the norwegian translation is the funniest movie i 've seen in many years the characters say so many funny things and make so many weird references to current events that i 'm amazed they kept having more options like the architect who can never say the name of the wizard miraculix correctly it becomes things like malcom i x and `` utenriks '' which is norwegian for foreign affairs like the word `` utenriks '' many of the translations does not give any meaning in english and probably not in french either so the translators must have made up their own jokes and done so very well of course they have a very good base to build on with a film that 's simply comical from beginning to end recommended in all languages with a good translation,1
what a terrible sequel the reason i give this film two stars instead of zero because it 's a movie that has violence and gore and critters yet it is planned out poorly and this god-awful sequel was done by none other than bum-bum-bum-bum mick garris the bonehead that brought you the remake of the shining which nearly got kubrick to nearly roll in his grave when he discovered it was actually made garris is also the man that brought you the sad sequel of the fly the fly which was a wonderful movie but garris 's movie nearly ruined john getz career anyway if you really want to see the crappy critters trilogy in order do n't that 's the mistake i made rent the first one or the third one or better yet do n't stoop to that level at all this movie sucked so bad that i ca n't believe it please avoid this crap shame on you mick,0
the eighties produced a lot of gory little horror flicks most of them within the slasher sub genre thus putting this film ahead of most of the rest of its ilk night of the demons is something of a cross between the ultimate gore film the evil dead and haunted house-cum-slash flick hell night films like this usually feature a deranged/deformed madman as the lead bad guy but here we have bloodthirsty demons which is always more interesting than a lunatic if you ask me there 's also a lot of comedy in this film and the first third of the movie could easily be the set up for a straight comedy film but once the characters enter the central location a sinister funeral home known as 'hull house the film morphs into the horror film that you would expect given the title the plot line is as simple as you 'd expect it to be and we follow a bunch of kids that decide to put on a halloween party inside said funeral home this turns out to be a bad idea however once it transpires that the house is possessed and the demons start to inhabit the kids bodies their only salvation lies on the other side of the underground stream ... but finding the gate to the grounds is n't as easy as it sounds the film 's centrepiece is the gothic mansion where the action takes place this creaky old house makes for a great horror film location the fact that it used to be a funeral home only adds to this director kevin tenney shoots the house well and a particularly good job is done of establishing the fact that the house is in the middle of nowhere and escape is difficult the comedy towards the start of the film is generally very funny and i was hoping it would keep up the laughs once the horror starts the film does have its comedy moments when the kids enter hull house but it 's never overly funny and it 's obvious that horror is the film 's main aim not that this is a problem but the night of the demons could have been a lot better had it fused these elements properly the characters are pretty much what you 'd expect from this sort of film but the acting suits the movie well and it 's clear that the young cast had a good time making this movie and it translates well to the screen the effects are good in that they suit the film well and as most of the death sequences are well executed it 's a good bet that most people wo n't get bored watching this this is n't a classic or must see film but i can highly recommend it as it offers a good time and will appeal to fans of silly horror fodder,1
blind date columbia pictures 1934 was a decent film but i have a few issues with this film first of all i do n't fault the actors in this film at all but more or less i have a problem with the script also i understand that this film was made in the 1930 's and people were looking to escape reality but the script made ann sothern 's character look weak she kept going back and forth between suitors and i felt as though she should have stayed with paul kelly 's character in the end he truly did care about her and her family and would have done anything for her and he did by giving her up in the end to fickle neil hamilton who in my opinion was only out for a good time paul kelly 's character although a workaholic was a man of integrity and truly loved kitty ann sothern as opposed to neil hamilton while he did like her a lot i did n't see the depth of love that he had for her character the production values were great but the script could have used a little work,0
do n't listen to what the critics have always said about this cute charming little movie madonna is great in this clever comedy i worked at a video store for several years and suggested this movie to lots of customers- no one ever brought it back and screamed at me for telling them to rent it everyone always enjoyed it it 's actually a great movie for kids too,1

i first saw this film in austria when it first came out and i was entranced by it it is a passionate and deeply moving work that should be experienced by all connoisseurs of motion picture art what a shame that it has never been released in dvd format perhaps one of these days that will be rectified as it would be a shame indeed if one of the best films ever made was forgotten and left to fade away in some film vault forever why is it that b movies like 'american wedding and 'eurotrip get widescreen and fullscreen releases and often a special edition with multiple commentaries and extras while great art pieces like 'the dead are all but forgotten,1
for years i 've been a big fan of park 's work and `` old boy '' is one of my all-times favorite with lots of expectation i rented this movie only to find the worst movie i 've watched in awhile it 's not a proper horror movie there 's no suspense in it and even the `` light '' part is so lame that i did n't know whether to laugh or cry i introduced my younger brother to chan-wook park and what a disappointment he got from this for me an idol has fallen if you loved movies like `` old boy '' the mr lady `` vengeance '' or even his short films on `` three extremes '' do n't waste your time the film 's not worth it,0
this movie had potential to be a good little high school thriller instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting the problem was there were too many unnecessary things a fight with the boyfriend random friends coming over to be killed it was obvious they were just killing time the main character was bland and uninteresting camilla bell had no emotion during this movie she was just there another problem was the fact that the killer was not a threat the children survive so it 's obvious they are going to let jill survive the only reason this got a four was because the last ten minutes when the killer finally comes out is actually exciting 4/10,0
i do not fail to recognize haneke 's above-average film-making skills for example i appreciate his lingering on unremarkable-natural-day-lighted settings as a powerful way to force a strong sense of realism however regarding the content of this film i am very sad to see that in the 21st century there is still an urge to pathologize domination-submission relations or feelings and/or bdsm practices the problem that the main character has with her mother is unbelievably topical as is the alienation and uncomprehension felt by walter i do n't mean the frustration of a lover which is not loved back in the same way which is understandable i mean that he looks upon her as if she were crazy or as if he was a monk come on i mean d/s is not something new in the world and i think it is rather silly to treat the subject as if it were something `` freakish '' or pathological it is n't in general films dealing with this subject are really lagging behind the times so for me i feel that this film ends up being quite a programmatical film worried with very outdated psicoanalitical theories is n't it nearly embarrassing and that does not really relate with real-life lives and experiences of those engaged in d/s relationships personal experience forums irc chatrooms even recent scholar studies will show this,0
spoiler -- in 1993 african-american director/actor mario van peebles followed up the tremendously popular urban-action film new jack city with `` posse '' the film was co-written and directed by van peebles who also stars as the main character jessie lee plot the film begins at the turn of the 20th century when the united states was embroiled in the spanish-american war apparently a time when the u.s. justice system could send convicts into military service jessie lee finds himself an unwilling enlisted man serving with an all-black cavalry troop in cuba some of his compatriots include little j stephen baldwin fast-talking weezie charles lane and the towering-but-simple obobo tiny lister they find a hidden chest of gold on a reconnaissance run and decide to keep it however the ambitious bigoted colonel graham zane finds out about the gold and is apparently willing to kill jessie lee and company for it a shootout between the graham 's forces and jessie lee 's leaves the colonel blind in one eye and his forces retreat jessie lee 's ragtag crew manage to smuggle themselves and the gold back to new orleans but it turns out that graham is n't far behind jessie lee and his allies are forced to go on the run heading west to a town called freemanville apparently freemanville was founded by blacks in the years following the civil war jessie lee 's father `` king david '' was the charismatic preacher who co-founded the town however as is revealed in intermittent flashbacks king david was soon brutally murdered by a white mob in a parallel of the ku klux klan terror campaigns that began around the same time jessie lee and company eventually find their way to freemanville only to find that the townsfolk are n't exactly glad to see himespecially when sheriff bates richard jordan of a nearby white township makes it clear that he wants jessie lee and his partnersdead or alive carver blair underwood is the sheriff and de facto mayor of freemanvilleand his own agenda may not square with having jessie lee around analysis the action sequences are all very credible and mario van peebles turns in a good performance as the brooding hero in the aftermath of the success of new jack city it was almost expected van peebles would helm a sequel or at least a similar urban-action follow-up instead van peebles looked 100 years into the past creating a mostly-black western effectively 'updating the black-themed westerns of the 1970 's and continuing the legacy of largely-forgotten black-themed cowboy films from the early 20th century unlike new jack city the film was independently financed and originally released through gramercy/polygram entertainment allegedly execs at the major studios balked when van peebles pitched 'posse to them some of the more `` curious '' casting at the time involved rappers big daddy kane and tone loc as father time and angel respectively in certain interviews mario van peebles has said that he often likes to cast against type in the years since the trend of casting rap singers in non-musical films would become almost commonplace keen viewers will notice several cameos by various entertainment personalities black-action film veterans like isaac hayes `` truck turner '' pam grier `` foxy brown '' and larry cook `` the spook who sat by the door '' show up as does stand-up legend nipsey russell not to mention tv producer stephen j. cannell who hired the junior van peebles to star in `` sonny spoon '' years earlier the film is bookended with woody strode `` spartacus '' in a key role,1
this is simply a good ole fashioned western .. not overly complex or long it does n't deceive itself in thinking that it was made but for entertainment still it is one of those westerns you can watch once and be done with without returning it features former partners randolph scott and glenn ford whose friendship is strong despite the fact that ford 's cheyenne rogers has been part of bank robbing he even steals scott 's sheriff steve upton 's horse without knowing it his good friend for which he is thieving in red valley upton is under heavy scrutiny for a bank robbing that ended with several dead claire trvor portrays countess maletta a friend of cheyenne 's who gives he and buddy `` nitro '' guinn 'big boy williams a place to stay for the time being cheyenne desires to go straight but finds that hard when jack lester bernard nedell and his bad bunch want to rob red valley 's bank it is actually jack who is behind the murders but cheyenne 's troubled past is hard to get away from he and nitro will be charged with the murders they did n't commit the robbery was one cheyenne did n't commit and it will be upton who must somehow save the day before lester gets away with murder there are sub-plots which include cheyenne 's falling in love with alison mcleod evelyn keyes the irony of the story is that alison 's father uncle willie is actually in cahoots with banker stanley clanton porter hall in a planned united theft with lester to steal the town of red valley 's loot will upton uncover uncle willie and banker clanton 's treacherous scheme will uncle willie be able to go through it without his conscience always bothering him this film has a terrific barroom brawl and a dandy of a climactic shootout columbia could n't have picked a better genre to begin the coloring process as this film has some fine mountainous shots as men give chase on horseback and such do n't expect to get your socks blown off but the film is simple and well paced,1
excellent story of lives that need repair .... one of those rare films that i could watch with my 7 and 8 year old daughters ... glenn close was excellent in the title role it was also nice to see christopher walken in a more normal role,1
great movie in a trainspotting style ... being billed as the welsh trainspotting but then so was twin town although this is streets ahead takes in a weekend in the life of cardiff clubbers good debut movie from kerrigan and some great performances in the cast go see then go clubbing,1
well-known comedians meekly admit they wish they could do real satire like bill hicks inbetween these pitiful testimonies we are treated to what an exceptionally talented comedian can achieve when he could otherwise be chasing fame and fortune he did n't get his own talk show but at least he was no one 's puppet,1
... or better yet watch fandango if you want to see a really intelligent and funny male college age road flick rolling kansas sounded promising in fact the program guide gave it 2.5 out of 4 stars which usually means it 's fairly watchable but i pretty much fast-forwarded through it usually road trip movies have great music but i ca n't even recall whether there was music the only high point was a small role with rip torn as a wise old hitchhiker/guru otherwise the jokes and timing missed all along the way the four main characters are unknown actors and i do n't remember seeing any of them in another movie oh yeah i see that thos hayden church was in it but he 's in everything good bad or indifferent this movie is about as funny as watching someone else stoned when you 're not,0
i am a huge fan of big loud trashy completely stupid action movies such as the rock con air etc all of these are great fun to watch but when you think about it extremely silly in the line of fire tells a story and it tells it well with plausibility as well as excitement and suspense it also addressed several important moral questions that really make you think the last shot of the movie is eastwood and russo sitting together on the steps of the white house watching the pigeons to gentle peaceful music and i felt a deep feeling of satisfaction this was because i cared about the characters and i was happy for them that their story had come to a happy conclusion it felt like a true story as the aging secret service agent tormented by the fact that he failed to protect jfk on that fateful day in dallas clint eastwood is fantastic he brilliantly conveys his paranoia and his personal need to stop his adversary on the other side of the spectrum is john malkovich as the creepy predator who tortures eastwood about what happened in 1963 by openly telling him of his plan to kill the current president this oscar nominated performance really gets under your skin throughout the movie malkovich talks to eastwood as if they are friends he does n't threaten him he does n't lie to him he does n't laugh at him but he tortures him with his unbearable friendliness right up to the last moment as well as this thrilling main plot there is a charming love story involving rene russo another agent and eastwood despite the age difference they have superb chemistry on screen and the director wisely does not let this dominate too much but keeps it as part of the backdrop which works nicely to sum up i love this film because it has a mind,1
this picture is a bad and blown up rip off of the michael pohl short film extinct from 1995. while michael pohl 's idea was original and perfect for a short film setting a sound of thunder 's plot was poorly adapted from pohl 's story and not fit for a full length feature film one would expect from a major hollywod studio the tragic flooding situation that ruined the sets in prague was just one bad link in a long rusty film production chain in this case for a studio to release such a product ... it is a shame especially for warner brothers a studio which broke new effects grounds with shows like babylon 5 in 1993. on television visual effects for television shows pioneering cgi in episodic television in the mid nineties were way more sophisticated than what is brought to the screen in this picture in cases like this sad as it may be can the film,0
simply miserable lana turner-ezio pinza vehicle pinza had a beautiful voice but he rarely uses it in a film that reminded me of `` the student prince '' with adults pinza is no leading man either he looks like an elderly man ready to collect social security and go fishing the plot is extremely thin and the supporting cast of barry sullivan marjorie maine and debbie reynolds are given so little to do sir cedric hardwicke comes in at the end to announce that our king ezio had better return to his people as far as i 'm concerned the faster the better is that lana turner really singing with pinza not bad if it is her the picture would also remind me in a way of the 1960 movie `` the prince and the showgirl '' with marilyn monroe and laurence olivier,0
i have been hooked on `` gg '' since midway through 2001-2002 2nd season when i tuned in to see `` smallville '' 10 minutes early thanks to `` beginnings '' i now have all but 2 episodes on tape right up through last night ep 4.9 i am a middle-aged straight male and this is the only weekly tv show i watch i love this series because a lauren graham is a damn fine-looking woman and funny and smart to boot b the dialogue is extremely well-written c it is flat-out hilarious putting overrated garbage like `` everybody loves raymond '' to shame many current tv comedies have been heavily influenced by the highly successful and much-despised slime-pit known as `` married with children '' where the viewer is encouraged to deride and feel superior to the characters in `` gg '' the characters have faults but we can see our own foibles in them and laugh with them not at them this is stimulating tv where the writers challenge us to keep up with rapid-fire exchanges and out-of-left-field pop-culture/literature/current events references i get immense pleasure out of watching these episodes over and over again catching all the one-liners and references to previous episodes stars hollow is its own little world one that i will happily continue to visit as long as the series runs,1
this movie lacked credibility for two reasons one no mayor of a major city and new york is certainly as major as it gets would allow a borough in his city to degenerate into such a violent place to live especially for voters who could have much to say about his or her future job security all of the victims in the movie were mostly elderly jewish or defenseless at 62-years of age i have never seen a movie that depicted such utter lack of respect for authority as this movie did even `` escape from new york '' which was fictional up front i.e they told you that this was science fiction did n't resort to such deep-seated violence in this movie most of the elderly victims were victimized and yet had guns but were unwilling to use them also in this movie and i have not seen the prior two is more lawless than the `` escape '' movie secondly gangs as far as my research shows have never been as cooperative as this movie makes them out to be on the one hand they catch a gang member from another gang working in their area and he 's killed yet when the heroes start shooting at the local gang bangers the next gang over is welcomed with open arms outside gang members are always viewed as outsiders and are stopped we are supposed to believe that when automatic weapons are used against our gang the other gangs want to be all into it why did the outside gangs come to help i believe that more than one gang from outside came to help what did they come for another question why was the gang leader in jail and why do fellow jail inmates ask his permission to attack bronson 's character this was not a great movie and i could go on but i wo n't,0
jack webb is riveting as a marine corp drill instructor in the d.i .. webb play sgt.jim moore a tough but fair marine whose job it is to prepare young teens for possible combat no one could have played this role any better that jack webb as a former marine i can assure that this is the most accurate film dealing with basic training in the corp. extremely entertaining,1
this movie is very difficult to understand why do the couple want to divorce no reason is given we do n't know anything about their life in lisbon and even nothing about marie 's job we may only understand that a certain bore appeared in this life we do n't even know who took the initiative of asking the divorce the way of filming is kind of special i did n't know the director 's name before the end of the movie when i read it on the screen i understood why it was so slow only 42 shots in a hundred minutes i counted them it reminded me of some japanese movies i saw in the 90 's in fact we must accept that this is the expression of another culture even if the set is occidental i do n't know if this story would have suited a japanese couple one can see the logic of the scenes but the result is a bore anyway i decided to watch it to the end because i wanted to get the spirit and the meaning of it all in fact i only understood that the story of these two beings may not be over yet since the train leaves the station without marie this is few for such a long time i ca n't recommend this work,0
an absolutely baffling western featuring flash-forward sequences set in an insane asylum south of hell mountain was one of the first films produced by the schlockmeisters at cannon film co-directed by william sachs who would later deliver such fan favourites as the incredible melting man and galaxina the film tells the very dull tale of a trio of gold robbers who stumble upon a cabin occupied by two women who are hiding some secrets that are n't worth discovering the cast most of whom never made another film try gamely but are hamstrung by the screenplay which generally makes no sense the asylum scenes are edited in to little effect and are punctuated by ridiculous sound effects and tape loops ultimately it 's a lot of talk and little else,0
on a dark gloomy new year 's eve night an ill nurse her life slowly ebbing away demands that david holm be presented to her at once we do n't yet know who david holm is or why this nurse wishes to see him but her only dying wish is to speak with him just one more time on the other side of the town nestled comfortably amongst the gravestones of the local cemetery holm victor sjöström who also directed and two of his drunken associates merrily await the coming of the new year `` here we can tell just when to drink the new year in '' exclaims holm casting a finger towards the large clock tower that looms through the darkness little does he know however that he will not be alive to greet it to pass the time holm cheerfully recites a ghost story he 'd once had a friend name george `` a merry fellow '' who was `` smarter than the rest of us '' on one new year 's eve several years ago george has broken up a potentially disastrous brawl fearing that the final man to draw his last breath before midnight would be condemned to drive the phantom chariot for the next year doing death 's bidding and collecting the souls of the deceased `` and gentlemen george died last new year 's eve '' concludes holm happily not bothering to contain his mocking skepticism of the man 's beliefs as fate has it of course an unexpected violent encounter results in holm 's death just on the stroke of midnight as the man 's transparent spirit rises gingerly from his earthly body he witnesses to his horror the distant approach of a phantom carriage the driver a frail cloaked figure a sickle clasped tightly in his hand steps down from the carriage and approaches we are astonished to discover that the driver is none other than a decrepit george preparing to pass on his ghastly duty to this year 's successor considering the era in which 'körkarlen is made the special effects in this film are absolutely superb cinematographer julius jaenzon used double-exposure photography to create the eerie ghostly silhouette of the carriage and its damned driver even today the end result is highly effective a particularly impressive scene involves the phantom chariot travelling to the ocean floor to retrieve the soul of a drowned man another scene eerily reminiscent of jack torrance jack nicholson in stanley kubrick 's 'the shining involves holm breaking down the kitchen door with an axe in order to reach his fleeing wife and children genuinely ominous and unsettling in its execution victor sjöström 's 'körkarlen is a fine work of cinema successfully portraying holm 's steady alcoholic decline his inevitable day of judgment and a final hopeful possibility of redemption,1
lots of scenes and dialogue are flat-out goofy but when you add it all up i.e machine 's daily cycle from depressing walkup to depressing bar to depressing burlesque hall to depressing smoke-filled poker games and back home again you get a weird sense that somebody somewhere is trying to give a faithful depiction of the junkie 's life circa-1955 whether it 's sinatra who obviously would have bumped up against this type of character growing up in hoboken and working in numerous bands or preminger who uses the soundtrack and the frankie-zosch subtext to slip the addict 's interior worldview past the hays code cage you get a good companion piece to on the waterfront which was filmed almost exactly the same time sort of a faux-realist work that leaves you realistically wondering how deep the drug culture is embedded in american life,1
as you may know norway is the most developed country in the world regarding to hdi human development index this film craftily reveal our future to us our future would be that of norway since we are all paddling to achieve the best and offer the least the life that was shown was maybe an exaggeration yet comparing today 's concerns with those of our ancestors it is not far-from-reality reasoning watching this film free from all of our pre-assumptions we can find both of our faces the one that is laughing at the brilliant scene of andreas dumping her girlfriend and the one that is searching through magazines hours and hours to choose some stupid chair among stupid collections the idea of the hole with the hope of lightness was another magnificent idea of the film the slight glory yet the only one and the effort that was put to reach it makes us feel closer to andreas although i was attracted mostly to the idea and production of the film trond fausa aurvaag played pretty well and the atmosphere of the film was quite matchable,1
then you will be a big fan of this movie its almost the same basic concept a nice mixture of music soul and drama i 'll admit i was a little aprehensive about seeing this movie i had only seen previews of a white trash girl chained to a radiator but i am a big fan of samuel l. jackson and i enjoyed hustle flow so i thought i would give it a chance i 'm very glad that i did it turned out to be more than just the surface story of a nymphomaniac southern girl being imprisoned by a 60 year old black man the story had heart and was very influential the music in this movie also added a nice touch craig brewer mixed his style from hustle flow into this movie except took a new spin and used the blues his musical scenes are still at the top of the charts as far as performance scenes go by he also has very interesting flashback scenes and just gives you an overall crazy feel during some of the more controversial scenes no doubt if you liked hustle flow you will love this movie and if you are a fan of the blues you should definitely go an see this i give it a 9 out of 10 very interesting film and it is extremely under rated shame go out and rent this movie,1
being raised at the time this movie was released has probably influenced my shallow mind but still this is n't a bad movie by any means it 's a movie about a hostage situation involving a prep school populated to some extent by endearing teenage boys who ca n't seem to get out of trouble what 's wrong with that it does n't have any big special effects but so what who needs special effects cinema 's decline began around the same time that special effects were popularized a coincidence i think not it turned movies with potentially good plot and feelings and turned them into a big substance-less light show for innocent kids and the self-medicated well you know not all movies need special effects about three fourths of the movies on the imdb top 250 are without special effects but almost all of the top grossing movies of all time have some special effects think about it star wars e.t. ghostbusters etc all good movies but the rest of the top-grossing movies are usually cliched tripe with non-sensical plots and lots of eye candy well some movies do n't need ny of that junk excuse me for going off on a tangent which i normally do but i 'm just so fed up with that special effects junk back to the point toy soldiers is simply a great movie i admit some of the content is a little corny and ripped off but so what every movie rips off another to some extent think of resovoir dogs countless `` appreciation '' sites dictate the fact that beloved quentin tarentino who i admit i like has copied many many many movies in the making of his first major film reservoir dogs many say that the entire plot is ripped off almost scene for scene from japanese and chinese gangster movies which mr. tarentino loved so much and probably still does sorry once again for the tangent toy soldiers is fun it has the whole insubordination from teenagers to unwanted members of authority i.e hostage takers it 's fun to see kids take over when they 're being held to something they do n't want to do hell teenage angst-inspired rebelion was the key topic to a great majority to 80 's comedies plus there 's the tension and thrill of having the characters use fire-arms and knock out the bad guys etc plus there 's some emotional points to the film when one of the characters dies the others have to cope and adjust it 's not perfect acting but it beats most of the other tripe out there in short toy soldiers is exciting interesting and fun how dare you jaded blowhards rate this movie poorly shame on you all personal rating 8/10,1
the sea inside 2004 javier bardem belen rueda lola duenas mabel rivera celso bugallo joan dalmau alberto jimenez tamar novas francesc garrido jose maria pou alberto amarilla nicolas fernandez luna dir alejandro amenabar an inspiring tale of a living death bardem is superb the true life account of spanish quadriplegic ramon sampedro and his petition to fulfill his desire for euthanasia by the right to die may not be considered a likely source of inspiration but this film is just that sampedro played superbly by bardem was a virile energetic young man when he lost the function to his limbs after a tragic diving accident recounted horrifically in flashback with a visceral jolt to the senses and for nearly thirty years lay paralyzed in bed while his loving family cared to his every need although his abilities to move were nil his mind was very much active and proved skillful as an inventor poet author and artist that kept his mind busy until he could no longer bear the thought of living longer in his stunted condition enter beautiful yet also afflicted with a crippling disease attorney julia the ethereal rueda who matches bardem beautifully as if they were indeed soul mates is hired to see through sampedro 's final wish to end his life and in turn becomes an aide de camp when he begins to open up to her like to no one ever before not too long has time passed and julia begins to investigate her charge 's past discovering many letters hidden away by his family when julia confronts ramon with this he at first is reluctant to discuss any thing with her but eventually he agrees with her that this may help his case and the project becomes a book in the making  a memoir/biography by way of free-style poetry and prose the film is a heartbreaking tale of the human spirit and how love eventually triumphs over heart ache in many forms including for ramon the unlikely love he shares with a complete stranger named rosa duenas a single mother who sees him on tv one day inspiring her to bicycle to his remote farmhouse in spain to get to know him and possibly change his mind about ending his life filmmaker amenabar who co-wrote with mateo gil the fascinating screenplay allows some fantasy into the mix when ramon envisions himself magically leaving his bed and flying across the bucolic landscapes to the eventual sea where he suffered so many years ago the cruel twist of fate that has imprisoned him for three decades the film is not a complete downer with a sly wit and occasionally humorous tone throughout that does n't dilute the impact of the story 's final act kudos also to the remarkable make-up job by james and jo allen do a tremendous job in aging the vibrant bardem to an aging man to full effect that should get them an acadamy award nod bardem and rueda deserve oscar nominations as two people with so much in common and despite rueda 's julia being married to a loving doting husband that a pair of people so made for one another it is down right impossible they were never together to begin with that 's just one of the cruelties that rings true but it is not by definition of the film as its whole it is a must-see and one of the year 's best,1
i have some great memories watching `` robin of sherwood '' on tv as a kid but i think i only saw michael praed´s episodes by some reason and recently my brother bought the new released dvd-boxes of the complete series it was great to see it again and it is the best of all the robin hood movies and tv-series the cast is great and the locations mixed with clannad´s music adds this very special feeling i personally think that praed is the best of the two robins but jason connery was a great choice to continue the series with ray winstone nicolas grace and robert addie is terrific in their roles as will scarlet the sheriff of nottingham and guy of gisburne it´s a pity that a fourth season never got made and i´ve also heard that the writer richard carpenter actually had plans to make a feature film following the events of the series robert of huntingdon connery could finally have married marion judi trott or maybe herne the hunter could resurrect robin of loxley praed and he could take his revenge against the sheriff as have been mentioned before if the producers of `` robin hood the prince of thieves '' would have been smart they would have got the cast from `` robin of sherwood '' and made the movie to a sort of sequel to the series as ray winstone puts it in the dvd bonusmaterial it would have been great to see them as old men just like in sean connery´s `` robin and marian '' who knows maybe we will se more of this perfect interpretation of the legend in the future in any case we can now watch our favorite series over and over again,1
very straight not happy with the movie the main center of the movie is the story where the lady is the mother of all the snacks and all the things if they can more explain that how this is happening and all the stuff then it was quite a fun and more rating for this movie the end was very short and sudden till now actor of the movie was to save her then at last he told sorry now we are late oh crap what was the story and how this all this thing happen i think they can put all these stuffs so the end user like us will be satisfied that yes we are happy with the movie any way but nice idea and nice try so i will say 4 or max 4.5,0
this movie was so awful i do n't even know where to begin ... the only positive thing i can say about it is that luke perry gave a good performance the entire movie was all over the place there was no explanation as to the cause only theories of the eruptions or rationals for their solutions or why it would work it was ridiculous all the characters and relationship between them was so cheesy you just wan na laugh there was just no background to any of them the `` love '' relationship seemed to have been added on to the script it was so awkward there 's an army man big black general with a permanent cigar in his mouth with the `` aaarrrgh i 'm the man '' attitude such a pathetic bad guy the two sidekicks who are supposed to be geniuses are acting like two 16 year old frat boys and then to create some action they decide to drop a rock on somebody 's shoulder and for the rest of the movie he 's coughing as if he was dying of a pneumonia or something ... and then plays hero cheesiest scene of all to help the plan which is to do who knows what ... its never a good sign when you find yourself laughing out loud in the middle of the dramatic scene ... in a nutshell do n't waste your time,0
this is primarily about love in wwii yet we must remember that it 's also a biopic for dylan thomas and those around him at this particular stage in his life the movie 's timing is just great it really captures what i think would have been the spirit during those times smiling and hoping you 're not going to get bombed while it may prove boring to some the movie does have a particularly dangerous edge to it at one point my heart was racing towards the end as the movie hits its climax it really does feature some poignant moments that are handled with skill by the four main actors cillian murphy is on fine form here as is matthew rhys both are polar opposites and it makes for an interesting watch the relationship formed between sienna miller and keira knightley 's characters is wonderful and we have the acting to thank and watch out for a cameo by suggs of 'madness despite all of this it 's a rather slow movie coupled with the fact it 's just shy of two hours it 's quite a slog to get to the conclusion overall it 's a solid non-fiction war movie with many wonderfully crafted moments that were no doubt helped by the splendid number of well-known british names behind the scenes but it really does drone on for too much at times still a worthwhile watch 7/10,1
jim carrey is a particular brand of humour and i personally think he 's a great actor eternal sunshine for example however this movie is presumably intended to be nothing more than a jim carrey vehicle so be aware straight off that if you do n't think his style of comedy is funny you will sit stony-faced throughout this film as it has nothing else to recommend it even if you do like carrey 's comedy i am not sure you will find this film amusing i went to see it on a saturday night at 10:30pm and the audience was definitely ready to laugh they giggled throughout the trailers which were n't particularly funny but when it came to the film stony silence i think it raised about five genuine laughs the problem with the movie is it does n't know what it wants to be it ca n't make up its mind whether it 's going for slapstick or serious if it were stupid throughout it could be forgiven but i 'm guessing it 's also trying to make a point about the relationship between the two central characters the strong point of the film is the hold-ups and there was plenty of potential here but these did n't start until about halfway through and remained largely undeveloped meanwhile you have to sit through the first excruciating 40 minutes as the couple 's life deteriorates four separate groups walked out of this film while i was there and if my flatmate had n't asked me to keep away from the house his girlfriend having just returned from a month-long vacation i would have done the same and in my entire 25 years of movie going i have done that just once before,0
i found the story to be just enough of a thriller that the wonderful henry mancici music did n't lull me julie andrews was excellant and i sure do n't understand why this movie had problems at the box office when it came out because it just makes me happy at the end to have everybody singing and i do like happy ever after endings which i think you can say this movie has along with some traditional blake edwards humor ...,1
gregory peck and gig young are competing for the same girl and after peck sends young on a very dangerous mission they blame him for his reasons feeling guilty peck goes on an almost impossible task of defending a fort where they are outnumbered by the indians peck chooses for this mission soldiers which he considers to be the scum of the earth and the actors that play these soldiers ward bond lon chaney jr. neville brand among others are excellent the script is derived from a novel by charles marquis warren who was a specialist in westerns as a writer director and producer the idea of using this type of men as heroes inspired many films that came out later including `` the dirty dozen '' made in 1967,1
clouzot followed le corbeau where no one knew who was penning the poison thus everyone was suspected with another masterpiece quai des orfevres four years later in which we know from the outset or think we do whodunnit top-billed louis jouvet does n't appear for forty minutes by which time clouzot has established a rich milieu of music hall music publishers etc and a fine cast of colourful characters angela lansbury lookalike lansbury appeared in woman of paris that same year suzy delair scores as the chanteuse whose desire to improve her lot inspires the jealousy of her husband/accompanist bernard blier who follows her to the home of an elderly letch only to find he is already dead from here things go seriously wrong his car is stolen before he leaves the premises so his pre-arranged alibi is out the window whilst meanwhile unknown to him his wife confesses to the murder to the photographer neighbour a closet lesbian in love with her who volunteers to return to the crime scene and retrieve delair 's scarf and as long as she 's there thoughtfully wipes her prints of the murder weapon a champagne bottle at this point investigator jouvet gets involved and from then on it 's a case of keeping the plates spinning in the air clouzot 's output was relatively small but virtually all of it was as spencer tracey said in another context 'cherce with le salaire de peur and les diaboliques still to come in short this is a must for french cinema buffs,1
this version of the gulliver stories is definitely bizarre the production adds a frame story that 's what it 's becoming famous for of gulliver returning to his wife and son in one vieweing incredibly overlong and sometimes fails to hold attention throughout but the odd images and diverse cast will keep you looking mary steenburgen does the best job of the cast danson seems a bit out of place with his american accent the whole asylum thing is awfully disturbing often but is nonetheless interesting and holds the journeys of gulliver together well danson 's character really does seem insane however ... he should have worked on being a little more believeable to everyone in my opinion also confusing is going from present to past anyone else think the yahoos are the ugliest things ever to grace a television screen or in line for it confusing sometimes boring but still highlighted by some good acting overall wonderful visual effects and a few enjoyable parts nbc 's first of many event films from robert halmi sr. see it for yourself to decide how it goes for you however i give it 1/2 out of 5 stars,1
viva la bam this `` jackass '' spin off focuses on the obviously scripted adventures of bam margera and his pals johnny knoxville brandon dicamillo etc this show while it has its fair share of gross-out comedy and crazy stunts focuses mainly on bam 's torturing of his parents i 'm sorry to say this bam but ... you 're in no way as cool as you think you are this ego tripped show is not only painfully unfunny and yes i liked jackass but also narcissistic beyond belief the overly stylized intro ends with bam coolly explaining that he 's going to do `` whatever the f '' he wants to how about you do something that is actually funny i liked `` jackass '' for what it was worth the camera-work was horrible any idiot could have made a better show with a camcorder in their parents garage but at least the show moved at a steady pace and never felt boring between the crazy dangerous or simply disgusting stunts the pals performed not so with `` viva la bam '' we follow our hero around as he plays pranks on his friends and tortures his relatives but never does it feel like anything else than really lame and scripted comedy the stunts and pranks are mildly entertaining but presented in such a tedious and dull fashion that they can barely make you smile `` viva la bam '' is a poor spin-off of that does little good but feed margera 's already too big ego i do n't recommend this lame and unimaginative show to anyone,0
imagine a gilligan 's island set in the african desert in modern times add people nowhere near as jaunty as the skipper or marianne -- and enough angst to fill a german psychiatrist 's office throw in a plot that manages to be interesting only episodically and literary parallelism that never delves deeply enough to truly satisfy season with a truly morose topic that 's been exploited since the first world travelers found themselves very very lost if the king is alive were n't a product of the reigning czars du jour of dogme 95 would this film be garnering as much attention dogme 95 is to hollywood as danish modern is to rococo a byproduct of digital technology this scandinavian movement seeks -- quite dogmatically -- to strip away artificiality in film-making by using more natural elements and returning to the essence of storytelling pearl harbor for instance is the dogme antichrist director/co-author kristian levring 's saga ponders interpersonal relations and human nature when placed under the fire of a life-threatening situation eleven people aboard a bus riding through the namibian sand dunes suddenly find themselves stranded in the remains of an abandoned town an african local who does not speak their language serves as observer and narrator whose insights are among the film 's most trenchant as the strongest heads off for a five-day walk to the nearest village the others stay behind surviving on dented-canned carrots and circumambulating their likely future as vulture chow former thespian henry decides that this rather unappealing crew needs a diversion and hand-writes king lear from memory he assigns roles and the group passes many days learning lines and rehearsing in an effort to divert their attention from the seemingly inevitable gradually the cast begins to lose it and the savageries of their natureor william golding might say human naturebegin to surface if you 've ever seen lord of the flies you know that these things can get ugly that being in a lifeboat situation can turn even mother teresa into the pmsing termagant of calcutta the film was shot using an international ensemble of american english french and south african actors who the dogme dogma dictates develop themselves and their roles quite organically the king was also filmed chronologically adding a sense of realism to the ever-increasing desperation of its characters after up to three hand-held cameras shot in digital results were transferred to 35mm film the performance that compels most comes from jennifer jason leigh who plays a boho pop tart trying to bolster the spirits of the group in any and every way she can henry david bradley is another finely played character whose passion for his life 's work ultimately saves the gang from utter despair it 's hard to feel too sorry for the otherscruel wives and their oafish husbands hirsute old womanizers sulky french intellectuals wealthy men who have more important places to be than marooned in the namibian desert beckett might hate this question but why is this group riding a bus together through remote africa in the first place life-threatening morbidity utter despair rendered in graphic detail a relentlessly tedious pace enjoy,0
this is one particular stooge short that actually uses satire in conjunction with slapstick a rarity as mentioned the title and concept for this short was `` borrowed '' from a feature film from the same year with clark gable called `` men in white '' it 's basically about the trials and tribulations of interns and their sacred cause for `` duty and humanity '' i saw this recently and almost treated it like the stooge version because it does take itself a little too seriously in any case `` men in black '' is so well written directed and not to mention original it did n't borrow a thing from chaplin or any of the others that the motion picture academy nominated it for an award as the best short comedy of 1934. some stinky short called `` la cucaracha '' outdid it though and stole the award some producer 's brother in law must have been on the academy 's voting board `` men in black '' pokes fun at the whole concept of the medical profession much in the same way that the marx bros. always did at this time may not be a fair comparison but i can see the marx bros. in this short in fact in their feature `` a day at the races '' there is a scene where there 's `` medical things '' going on and they cause anarchy as usual my guess that this particular short was judged along those lines and hence why it was nominated in the first place try this in fact watch this short first and then watch `` duck soup '' or `` day at the races '' with the marxes and then see if there is n't the same great quality of comedy,1
this movie is probably one of 3 worst movies made in history i rented this by chance without reading reviews and wow do i regret it really has no plot does n't really follow the vampire genre just plain god awful watching this movie will taint your enthusiasm for vampire movies i felt like the writer/director/producer went on this drug binge and had hallucinations and tried to recreate it on film whole time i wanted the movie to end .. but the ending was even more whacked if this review can save just one person from watching this crap i felt my time spent on registration and writing this review was well worth it,0
chris smith 's american movie is an insightful examination of the american dream the movie focuses around mark borchardt an independent film maker from wisconsin mark has dreamed of becoming a great writer and director since he was a teenager and had an out of focus hi8 camera the movie follows mark through his attempt to make his dream feature film northwestern there are a number of hilarious scenes in the film as mark goes through pre-production of northwestern and later his short film coven pronounced co-ven the correct pronunciation mark says `` sounds too much like oven '' which he plans to use to raise money to complete northwestern this film 's insight and humor is on par with roger and me michael moore 's great film i first viewed it at a chaotic sundance film festival screening that brought out the spirit of the movie- a giant air duct fell from the ceiling at the beginning of the movie hit seven people and caused a twenty-five minute delay half way through the film the sound started fluttering and the projector had to be stopped to fix it and in the last twenty minutes the projector stopped and the film burned up despite the delays the audience stayed through the movie and gave it a standing ovation american movie also won the grand jury prize for documentary at the end of the festival i highly recommend this fine film worth sitting through any hellish screening,1
at last sandra bullock is indeed a beautiful woman but i 've finally found a film that she gets to be an actress forget the predictable keanu-fodder of speed forget the predictable kleenex-fodder of while you were sleeping this tests her and she is great a techno-feminist role that really works well on screen on a subject that is very close to the bone the issues raised do n't seem far-fetched at all and the whole experience helped along by a fine supporting cast makes for quite an un-nerving couple of hours you may never enter another chat-room again in fact i 'm getting quite nervous just writing this review ... er ... bye,1
i saw this documentary film at the 2005 slamdance independent film festival this documentary is shot directed and edited by a son craig of his mother 's year long battle with cancer shot over the course of one year `` the closer she gets '' is a documentary in the truest form and gives you an inside look of a family 's struggle with battling with the cancer the viewer gets an inside point of view of the effects cancer has on a family as well as the individual throughout the entire process i have never seen such an honest film this is a powerful and raw film and since it was n't shot by an outsider you get the true emotions of everyone involved many documentaries are shot by an outsider but having this story told by the son adds another emotional level to the film unlike any i have seen before on this subject or any other this is a touching story that everyone should see and can relate to i would highly recommend it,1
this mess starts off with a real tank running over a car intercut with images of a toy tank this is followed by a family driving home from a birthday party without saying anything the unexplained tank and the untalkative family take up i swear over 10 minutes of film finally the family sees a car after it has been in a wreck and decides to report it to the proper authorities only to find that the citizens of the town are all hiding in their houses and the cops are hiding in the police station interesting almost when the town folk come out due to the family 's presence we learn that both the writer and editor are conspiring to substitute suspense with incomprehensible storytelling techniques in the hopes that the audience 's inability to tell what 's going on will somehow bring unease upon the audience ... and it works ... but not in the way they thought it would i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense not in a fun david lynch sort of way but a sort of i-walked-in-during-the-middle-of-a-boring-conversation sort of way over the course of the next hour we learn that the movie-makers try to bore us into being afraid by showing tediously mundane scenes combined with the above-mentioned `` what 's going on '' type scenes the plot involves something along the lines of gentle-looking old folks putting children into a trance through the power of satan and then bringing them to a party to play with toys and an even more sinister intention and it 's up to a group of white men everybody 's white in the movie to grab their guns and save the day and a tag-a-long eye candy woman who whines at the drop of a hat they look for the kidnapped children by looking in random places and yelling the kids names this is a great horror movie for any person who has never seen a horror movie because that person is frightened by the mere thought of satanism paganism wicca or even catholicism due to a lifetime diet of brainwashing from the trinity broadcast network this represents satanism as elderly folks in halloween costumes with candles while mingling at a party in front of an ankh replete with a priest spouting completely made-up nonsense about satanists while calling them `` witches '' the message that anything that is n't protestantism can be all thrown into the same category for easy condemnation about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo-satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words highlights include a guy laughing at the idea of little green men for a solid 3 minutes a family staring out of the windows of their car without talking for 10 minutes while listening to elevator muzak a priest studying satanism for 4 minutes with ooh-so-scary drawings of demons to scare the church lady crowd random shots of dolls random shots of children paint instead of blood at every chance film school level dream sequences introduces unimportant characters who do nothing before they exit sometimes they act as if the nothing that they 're doing is a big deal the directing is sloppy at best an example of the directing includes a scene at the beginning where a man and woman are kissing and the man pulls away to look lovingly into her eyes and some dark red paint falls on her cheek looking up they see that it 's not blood but droplets from a girl 's snowcone snowcones are ice and colored / flavored water and would not have produced droplets of the same texture as paint not to mention the fact that her snowcone was a bright reddish-orange hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing it then cuts to an alternate shot of the man woman and girl and shows that she 's standing about four feet away from them so the snowcone would n't have dripped on the woman even if she 'd held her snowcone out over the woman 's face way to go editor of course the acting is blah the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting the director 's most offensive technique is to give the actors no motivation and then go out for lunch as the unblinking eye of the camera leers as the actors make fools of themselves and finally after all that we get to an ending that would 've been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell,0
as a fan of the old series i must say that this is at best a parody of a much beloved series first the old series would at least attempt to follow some military structure i know in this p.c world it is not the thing to do but hey do n't turn it into the care bears in the old series beachead was a hardspoken soldier now he is a teenage mutant turtle another thing is the flying tank ok it flies out of the cobra base and bounces off the copter and they are both ok lets face it if the next one is not better this could spell the end of g.i.joe,0
nostalgia is n't always the best reason to watch a movie more often than not the movies you loved as a kid will disappoint you as an adult while there are exceptions to this rule it 's hard to justify owning a dvd of krull regardless of how many insightful the director 's commentary may be but stay sharp gen x/y'ers because the dozens of disappointments dominating your trip down memory lane might stop you from stumbling across one worth revisiting one surprise film worth another look is joel schumacher 's flatliners the supernatural thriller starring 80 's popcorn heavyweights keifer sutherland kevin bacon julia roberts and billy baldwin you would think that a stew comprised of this cast the flamboyant flair of schumacher and the über slick eye of cinematographer jan de bont would result in something sickeningly stodgy but calories aside ... flatliners ai n't half bad even though it 's production design is inexplicably over-the-top and the photography is achingly over- stylized replete with neon soaked streets spewing endless billows of steam flatliners still manages to be an effectively dark and compelling thriller if there 's an explanation why flatliners was forgotten it might be because 1990 saw the release of another far superior supernatural thriller jacob 's ladder had flatliners been released a year or two after jacob 's ladder it 's likely schumacher 's flashy thriller would have been dismissed as a toned down commercialized rip-off of adrian lyne 's nightmarish masterpiece but with these films being released in the same year flatliners enjoyed a different fate tripling jl 's take at the box office despite being a watered down version of a similar premise the passage of time has n't been as kind to flatliners it has been lost atop a dated heap of throwaway 80 's brat pack dreck while jl has cemented its reputation as a timeless classic fates aside jl is seamlessly terrifying and it manages to keep audiences guessing right up until the last frame whereas flatliners falls victim to over- simplification and hollywood conveniences that drag down the final act into a predictably tidy denouement comparisons between the two movies is unfair and ultimately overlooks flatliners ability to represent the 80 's at its quintessential best released at the end of a decade of shallow excess flatliners will always be dated by its hairstyles and clothing styles but in fairness it should also be remembered as a well executed movie at or at least near the top of its particular heap of dreck for intents and purposes it 's an entertaining walk down memory lane,1
you thought after `` traumschiff surprise '' that german comedy ca n't get worse it can this comedy is yet another attempt at perpetuating stereotypes of gay men masked as a nice comedy the initial concept openly gay men in soccer sports would have been a great opportunity to erase some stereotypes but ... the real intended message of the movie seems to be in what way gay men are oh-so-different from straight men absolutely silly of course even gay sex is treated as being of less value than straight sex this movie only tries to serve straight audiences wanting to laugh about stereotypical gay men well do n't waste your time on german comedy movies,0
classic excellent good fair tragic review oldboy is not for everyone it 's pervasive violence its live octopus eating and it 's unimaginary story the film focuses around a man who 's been kidnapped and is imprisoned for 15 years oh dae-su is released only to find that he must find his captor in 5 days now the story though may seem gripping to start with but once watching this bloated and un-original blood fest it develops into a mash of bitter blood and a forceful film it 's directing is on par of average and by no means the standards of what a south korean thriller should be oldboys acting scenes are paralleled with dull humour and a poorly writtern script oldboy is occasionlly presented with thin straw performances that one could only feel shameful about verdict not for everyone but it 's scope and vision is n't clear enough to see further than the grey abyss of fog tragic,0
this is one of my favourite comedy films chris farley is hilarious as the accident prone moron and david spade is perfect playing the straight-man to farley the dialogue between the two of them is brilliant the scene where the two of them are in the car singing along to superstar by the carpenters is a classic chris farley was a great comic actor who had amazing potential he will be sadly missed,1
as is the case with many films of this ilk my non catholicism got in the way of my understanding it the church has this mass of rules which have been put together over centuries we have a short time to learn them and have to accept them at face value then throw in some bad guys getting revenge for a long distant act against them working under these rules and attempting to circumvent them and you have this book and movie i found myself thinking `` that 's pretty cool why did they do that '' there 's this casual thing in the robert langdon character where no matter what the issue he seems to always make the right first move i suppose it 's like watching csi where they solve incredibly complex cases in a matter of days they know the lay of the land in this film there is so much land and so little time to really understand everything that is going on but if you create robert langdon you need to set him to work that 's ok because heroic nerds like him have been saving the day forever i thought the film was fun i thought the da vinci code was fun too interesting and not as bad as people seemed to think this is a marvel to look at and never stops for a second,1
a movie visually graceful but interesting is mainly the plot the film depicts a zigzag progress of exploring the main actor 's innermost feeling max who has lived in new york for two years and intend to marry a girl he met there comes back to paris and unexpectedly meets his ex-girlfriend whom he still fancies very much but finally finds out the one he loves the most in fact is her best friend non-linear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well the three women max has met symbolize something we must pursue although possibly having no clear picture about the underlying motivations his fiancee is the one he needs rather than the one he loves and thus completely no loyalty we can see she gives him also no love but only stability true love also can not be found in his relation with the ex-girlfriend merely a fantasy for him to escape many things very romantic he has done for her but almost nothing seems amenable the one who really animates max 's life in fact is her best friend the equilibrium achieved at the end is not identical to the initial equilibrium because max has understand much more about his innermost feeling the nonlinear structure makes the progress of searching look more complicated not equally ingenious as `` pulp fiction '' but things seem much more natural in `` the apartment '' max is not the only character who undergoes a transformation and in fact interesting is also the description to romane bohringer the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful a good commentary of today 's love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing,1
i think is a great and a very funny movie the story is so funny the daughter nicole brings her father andre in some very embarrassing situations in an effort to impress the boy of her dreams the daughter pretends that her father is her lover.you just have to see heigl is lovely as nicole perhaps too lovely i 'm not sure why she 'd need to lie to hook anyone gerard depardieu acts very great in this comedy film he is so fun to watch if you like comedy and romantic film you just have to see this i think you can see this film many time and you will still have a good laugh in an effort to impress the boy of her dreams the girl pretends that her father is her lover,1
absolute grabber of a movie and given its age years ahead of its time i first saw this the week my dad came home with a neighbor 's tv that the guy had thrown on the scrap heap a tinkerer with all things electrical dad had it working inside two days this was july 1955 ... and then probably only the third house in the street to have television pretty much the first thing we ever saw on that grainy and flickering old 12-inch screen was this film `` it 's pretty old dear '' i recall my mom telling me almost 50 years on and it does n't seem any older rather like world war i in that respect terrific little fantasy about a london omnibus carrying thirteen passengers that crashes killing one of their number then in flashback we pick up on the lives of these people and what brought them to being on this bus that very day returning to the crash at the end of the film the victim 's identity is revealed perhaps the inspiration behind the 1960 movie the list of adrian messenger if ever you come across this little gem i suggest you watch it,1
this is yet another pseudo-intellectual `` let 's make the nazis look real bad '' movie the nazis were pretty bad no doubt most of already know that however that does not necessarily make every movie on the theme good a discovery channel presentation of `` the wannsee conference '' would have been much more interesting `` conspiracy '' falls on its ass between two categories documentary and drama it does n't cut it as a documentary the movie is too staged and the presentation too common it does n't cut it as a drama the characters are too shallow and conflicts too easily solved another thing is the tagline `` one of the greatest crimes against humanity was perpetrated in just over an hour '' as the movie shows the wannsee conference the meeting had nothing to do with reaching a consensus on the final solution the decision on the solution had already been taken by the ss the sole purpose of the meeting was to make all significant stakeholders commit themselves to an already established plan there were no decisions or plans made at the wannsee conference there was only threats and coercion some needed less than others finally one thing the movie does show although in no exceptional manner is man has a tendency to turn to culture and aesthetics in an attempt to hide for himself the fact that he is committing appalling atrocities this is seen in most powermongering leaders and politicians,0
simply beautiful one of the best mind -- umm ... screws -- in existence both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who -- maybe -- has written a subversive tract moscow could learn a few things from the torture techniques in this film they could also do worse than hiring alan rickman five out of five stars and at present 1-20-2000 2 on my top 100 films of all time list,1
a high school track star falls dead after winning a race shortly after her older sister patch mackenzie returns home in time to notice that all of her sister 's track team members are disappearing who could the killer be you may not care enough to want to find out crude cheap amateurish slasher is just about completely worthless although top-billed christopher george as the nasty hard-driving track coach tries to give it a lift with an intense performance not even the gore is worth mentioning the whole thing is lame from beginning to end starting with opening the movie to a track meet montage set to disco music and the casting of e.j peaker once a co-star of the movie `` hello dolly '' as a character named `` blondie '' that 's right `` blondie '' this may mean that we are n't supposed to take the movie seriously but in any case it 's a shambles it 's the kind of routine slasher junk that makes the `` friday the 13th '' movies look like works of art in comparison the only point of interest may be wanting to see an early film appearance by vanna white of all people 2/10,0
just saw this at the madison horror film festival and was disappointed a few shocking funny moments fisting the hollow carla a urinating harpy in the dreamland and two competing interesting premises similar to new nightmare with belief bringing a mythical character to life and also lost highway with a man living out a fantasy in his head but had long stretches of no movement and incoherent plot development just because you use the framework of dreams or a mental fugue state does n't make it lynchian you need the compelling visuals and creepy performances positive things dr. maitland had real comic timing and all the girls were very cute carla 's father chalmers and ingrid pitt looked like they were having some fun and tom savini at least looked like he had his lines memorized and we could n't see if he was just reading cue cards i get the hammer references but it looks like the director realized the script was a snoozer and just added some shocks to try and get some laughs out of whatever footage he could put together but they do n't work because they 're too few and far between and create an inconsistent tone condense this to 30 minutes of all the fun parts and you could have a surreal goofy short but at feature length skip it it 's not `` so bad it 's good '' it 's just `` so bad it 's boring '',0
i do n't mind some adult humor but this feature was just downright dirty the first 10 minutes consisted of pryor swearing at some guy taking pictures followed my even more profanities i do n't know what happened between that time the the last 5 minutes because i walked out after seeing this i never looked at richard pryor the same way again and to think that he actually went on to host a childrens show if profanity and tasteless unfunny dirty jokes make you laugh then you 'll probably enjoy this but if you 're an `` old-fashioned '' type then do n't bother,0
i watched this show until my puberty but still i found it to reflex many situations that worry us when we 're teenagers although it was a family oriented show until the mid 90 's it focused more on the young adults and their situations that 's why i loved `` step by step '' i mean it offered situations for every age and unlike many shows of it 's kind it delivered expectations let 's be honest this was n't an extremely funny show no but it had some situations that you could feel related to but only funnier there was an extremely good charm between patrick duffy and susan sommers duffy rocked sommers was tender and actually funny i was in love with stacy keegan because she was extremely sexy loved her legs and witty but sasha mitchell stole the show with his cody character he was the man back in the day oh the memories nowadays this show was n't been able to adequate correctly on the new generations and that 's why it should be kept in the vault of memories that 's it only memories thank you step by step for making my puberty funnier,1
from director billy wilder double indemnity the seven year itch some like it hot i can see that this is a bit of an under-shown and underrated film one to be seen this is the biographical story of charles augustus 'slim lindbergh james stewart who in 1927 wanted to be the first man to cross travel solo flight from new york crossing the atlantic ocean to reach paris in a small cockpit the first half hour or whatever is seeing lindbergh getting permission to do it and the construction of the plane named `` the spirit of st. louis '' and making all necessary preparations then of course the rest sees his perilous journey crossing the journey overcoming tiredness near fuel loss and moments of losing sense of direction but he was successful also starring murray hamilton as bud gurney patricia smith as mirror girl bartlett robinson as benjamin frank mahoney robert cornthwaite as harry knight sheila bond as model/dancer marc connelly as father hussman arthur space as donald hall harlan warde as boedecker and dabbs greer as goldsborough apparently lindbergh was a bit younger so stewart was a shade too old to play him but then again you ca n't think of anyone else that could do better it is a witty and emotional drama with stewart as always being fantastic great music score by frank waxman and good direction from wilder a good little known gem it was nominated the oscar for best special effects the only award it was ever nominated james stewart was number 12 on the 100 greatest movie stars he was number 3 on 100 years 100 stars men and he was number 13 on the world 's greatest actor very good,1
this movie looked fun on the cover and i honestly thought 'how bad can this be little did i know out of the gate the dialogue was unbearable it was contrived unrealistic and not even interesting dialogue on upn syndicated television shows is more natural sounding the story was implausible and had nearly zero play-off at the end the end with the snake is almost confusing and seemed staged the only remotely interesting character is rose mcgowen 's who is mute which prevents her from being ruined with cliche ridden garbage dialogue well at least until the end when even she has to speak the only thing that even gives this a 3 over a 1 or 2 is rose mcgowen 's nude scene truly awful save yourself the trouble and rent something more interesting like a barney video,0
this film is a brilliant retelling of shakespeare 's classic love story complete with `` kinky sex body piercing and dismemberment '' it does follow the same spirit as all the other troma movies except combat shock ... that sucker was depressing but it 's not only for troma fans anybody who appreciates lowbrow visuals and a hilarious script will without a doubt fall in love with this movie do n't expect pretentious artistic-wannabe crap like the version of r j with claire danes and leo dicaprio this one knows its a silly movie and draws its humor from that the acting is also surprisingly good and you can just feel sammy capulet 's pain as he tries to put his brain back into his head the soundtrack which contains many original and high-energy bands like the wesley willis fiasco supernova and the meatmen is also four-star this movie should be viewed by all because it remains faithful to the original story while still being jam-packed with troma 's trademark gore/sex humor,1
"this show is pathetic i ca n't even begin to imagine how anyone with an iq greater than that of a can of split pea soup that 's past its expiration date can willingly sit through this garbage for an entire half hour it is one of those rare shows that is so mind-numbingly awful in every respect you can honestly say you are less intelligent simply from watching it i conducted a study and found that the average person loses 10 iq points for every fifteen seconds they watch this show that is second only to another comedy network abortion popcultured 19,863,221 iq points per second lost and pretty much a tie with girls will be girls keys to the vip owes each and every one of us an apology whenever i watch this travesty of a show i feel sad for society how is it allowed to continue",0
come on fantastic drama on screen are you joking folks i would n't put horrible molly gross to play even in school play where did these people learn acting borrowing some papers from their neighbors actor terrible plot awful acting heh ... why do you take us for an imbeciles what can i say more i understand this is an tv production and the acting is not supposed to be the one from citizen kane but nevertheless they should try it harder in order to earn their money and apart from that what can be said in 10 lines for a simple movie like this u wan na article in the morning paper to say what worse film in the decade ok you want it you got it,0
i saw 2:37 at the toronto international film festival in september and was blown away by it a scene of panic opens this film at 2:37 pm set in an adelaide high school this scene is left unresolved as we revert to the beginning of the day and are introduced to the teenagers getting ready to go to school the audience becomes intimate with each of the main characters and explores the day-to-day issues facing teenagers including drugs promiscuity being gay bullying and violence each scene is played again and again from different teens perspectives and is reminiscent of gus van sant 's elephant this is a remarkable film by first-time director murali k. thalluri it was made with non-professional student actors and work-shopped through an unprecedented 76 drafts of a script it features stunning performances by a number of the student actors particularly teresa palmer in the role of melody this coming-of-age film is both intimate and thought-provoking with a surprising and disturbing ending,1
let 's see what annoyed me most the extra long dance scene in the beginning watching people twirling around so much i got dizzy ... without even showing where the music was coming from ... all part of a college graduation that had nothing to do with the rest of the film or perhaps it was the fact that each scene lasted about fifteen minutes longer than they had to what a drag this film is and the most annoying aspect is the bad guys are so bad so obviously horrible that it seems as if the director were making this film for second graders `` these people are bad ... these people are good '' whenever a movie has its agenda-heart on its sleeve i am beside myself there 's a scene in a rollerskating rink that seems totally out of place long drawn-out love scenes with the main character and a russian prostitute that seems more like a rock star and his sexy groupie john hurt 's character who is part of the overlong beginning scene drinks and disagrees with the overdone villains his death scene could very well be the stupidest in history and i hear everyone even the haters of this film talk about how gorgeous the cinematography is i think it looks washed-out watch `` days of heaven '' if you want to see gorgeous backyards this movie is even worse than the anti- hype it 's pointless the epilogue showing the main character in a yacht was almost as dumb as the prologue the battle scenes are tedious and dizzying this movie is really bad avoid it unless you love bad movies because this is the king of them,0
this movie is the absolutely perfect way to explain what a good movie is it is a movie both for children and parents and it is `` timeless '' i saw this movie before ocean 's eleven and must admit that the actors in oe has class in advance but the play of klatretøsen is much more down-to-earth and moving why i say ocean 's eleven is the fact that these 2 movies has many things in common and klatretøsen is that good that it can bear comparison with oe the 3 youngsters play their part in a perfect way not to believe compared to what we are used to in denmark the different cases of impossible acts is handled in a way that you would n't belive from many young actors and sometimes not even from the `` old boys '' the story again it has things in common with ocean 's eleven except for the reason of stealing the money and in klatretøsen they need to climb up to the strongroom the part in which the young people has to take care of ida 's younger brother gives a fine element in the movie try to imagine how to rob a bank with a 2 year child with a nappy on your arm this movie can bear comparison with most `` grown up '' movie like mi2 and ocean 's eleven yes i do believe it is that good it is best to see it in a theater as all the children in the room comments the movie and these comments will stay in your hearts forever regards klavs,1
if not the best movie ever made `` babette 's feast '' is certainly among the most loving this is a wonderful exploration of the meaning of artistry generosity loyalty and grace humor is mixed with tender longing characters are treated with searching honesty but also deep respect there are meditations here on memory fate old age and faithfulness marvellous camera work by cinematographer henning kristiansen seldom have wrinkled faces looked so luminous in the candle-light the meal is accompanied by delicious period music brahms mozart and simple folk hymns enjoy this feast for the eyes and the spirit for as the general says `` mercy and truth have met together and righteousness and bliss shall kiss one another '',1
i thoroughly enjoyed gabrielle burton 's story of a mysterious gift and how it effects it recipients in the past and present the talented burton family of five film-making sisters an author mother and dancing dad offer a charming plot respectfully edited for clarity memorably chosen songs and a beautifully filmed piece that made me laugh and cry as the characters vulnerablility invited me into their predicamant there was a farce-like attitude about this work with touching undertones of innocent wonder fanatastic,1
`` milo '' is yet another answer to a question nobody ever asked.do we really need more slashers i for one think we already have more than enough.i guess the professional tall guys overcharged so in this one we deal with a murderous kid that 's also a zombie or a ghost when he feels like it.a long time ago he drowned but that did n't bother him and he still kills people `` friday the 13th '' what 's that .one day his survivors have a big reunion and as a surprise twist milo comes to pay them a visit.through some really bad shots that show everything except the murders the cast is thinned out till only the final girl is left to find out milo 's dull i mean dark secret.she and her friends have been dying to know.once discovered milo goes on yet another murderous rampage is n't it his bedtime yet and the girl well she screams a lot.the acting is not even bottom of the barrel the barrel refuses to be associated with it.milo can be one creepy bastard from time to time i give him that but some movies just ca n't be saved without a great script or gratuitous nudity,0
hard to get in-depth with this kind of stuff since there is absolutely no existing shred of even partial reason for watching it let alone expressing an opinion on it i do n't know anything about this watched it for a laugh and stayed for the fake breasts apparently it 's an unofficial sequel to 1982 's `` slumber party massacre '' which i did enjoy as a fun slasher `` cheerleader massacre '' looks like a late-nite soft-core cinemax porno and not surprisingly chicks like nikki fritz and samantha phillips prolific t a actresses are in this plenty of nekkid hooters and not much else ... a group of 20-something high school cheerleaders two random guys and the fat stupid comic-relief slob become stranded in the country and find a house where they plan to stay the night the recently escaped `` slumber party '' killer is in the area and begins killing them off there 's no gore or originality and i would n't say the nudity is a real `` selling point '' since this is just about as boring a slasher movie can be absolutely terrible ...,0
i ca n't believe some of the comments here in the reviews the film is dated of course and from our comfortable viewpoint in the age of cgg a lot of the special effects are deeply unconvincing now but even allowing for this helen of troy is so bad that it is almost laughable the scripting is awful just awful with no characterisation at all the performances suffer as a result you can see the likes of hardwicke and andrews writhing in an agony of embarrassment as they deliver the most ridiculous shallow trite codswallop lines the writers seem to feel the need to explain almost everything in a dreadful didactic screenplay that allows the viewer to decide nothing for him/herself at all the beginning of the movie spells out the historical background as if no one had ever heard of ancient greece i know they had american audiences to take into consideration but the patronising way we are told everything twice to make sure we understood the action is really awful i honestly ca n't believe the comments above describing this movie as a great epic film even allowing for the comparatively primitive cinematography and the relative sophistication of today 's audience this movie truly stinks,0
we are taken to a convenience store where nick is looking at coins in his hand figuring if he can get the special a 69 cents 20 ounce cup of coffee that comes with a free pastry he decides to go for the larger size which of course is more expensive plus it does n't qualify him for the cake he tries to argue with the indian clerk at the register who keeps her ground with her it 's a matter of principle well nick gets irritated not getting his own way and proceeds to kill her the tone of the story is set from the start the people we are about to meet are not nice guys there are nick his girlfriend dallas and their partner billy hill they are drug dealers nick decides to visit casey his friend and former partner in crime in houston he wants to do one more transaction and then go to paris with the profits from selling the drugs he is bringing what he does n't realize is that casey has gone straight he is an architect married to christine and wants to adopt a baby casey does n't appreciate his former friend bringing drugs into the house he decides to get rid of the stuff by flushing them down the kitchen drain the untimely arrival of ice a pizza delivery man takes casey by surprise this man has been sent to kill him but before that casey brings out some weed to share with ice who has a talent for rapping it is at this point that dr. jarvis the man from the adopting agency arrives casey 's application shows a two year gap that he ca n't justify jarvis begins to doubt about the prospective father at this time dallas makes an entrance she is a woman that asks questions point blank like when she demands to know whether jarvis enjoys watching porn jarvis who is aroused ends up leaving in a huff dallas has decided to seduce casey at all costs there is a surprise in store as billy hill enters the picture and he does n't like what he sees shooting dallas in the process billy hill has also come to off casey but he is overpowered casey gets the visit of kasarov who wants to get his money from nick in his absence he 'll take it from casey kasarov gives a deadline and casey makes up his mind to outsmart all these low lives he has all the parties come to his house at an appointed hour and the different factions will take care of themselves in the end casey has a better plan that includes taking christine for a stay in paris never having heard about `` thursday '' we were drawn into it because of the talent in it skip woods directed his own material this seems to be a film with good intentions at times the film remember others of the same genre not a sin by any shape or form which seems to be the main objection of the negative comments left here in the imdb site for starters `` thursday '' shows a witty skip woods that has gone to write other films notably `` swordfish '' the screenplay is divided in chapters with suggestive titles pertaining to the action denis lenoir does wonders with the mostly interior photography thomas jane makes an excellent contribution to the film with his casey although hard to imagine he has beat the odds and made something out of himself this actor seen recently in the television series `` hung '' is one of the actors we do n't tire of watching a dark haired aaron eckhart is a welcome addition to any film he is a greasy criminal that shows no redeeming qualities or anything close to remorse and does n't hesitate to involve his former friend in his scheme james legros has nothing to do same goes for paulina porizkova a gorgeous creature that is only a distraction or an afterthought to add a sexy angle we enjoyed glenn plummer who appears as ice he does a mean audition on the telephone michael jeter and mickey rourke also appear,1
well what 's wrong with the title `` separate lies '' accused elsewhere of not being `` exciting '' it 's cunning subtle and a bit poetic of course there 's a phil collins song and a james belushi film called `` separate lives '' which are alluded to here but the real point is the ethical dilemmas of telling lies at different levels that the film probes ok it 's not an `` in-your-face '' hilarious title but then it 's not an in-your-face hilarious film please give british films like this a chance they do try to make people think about important things as here how far do you go to protect your life even if it is a bit rotten against unexpected disaster maybe you tell lies maybe you ignore your loved ones lies that can wear a lot of people out american movies on this theme are abundant but they usually go much further by involving the use of firearms which are not a part of everyday life here in europe maybe we 're not so `` exciting '' over here but we do n't expect slogan-like film titles for films that are not aimed at a massive public,1
wonderfully funny awe-inspiring feature on the pioneers of turntablism dj shadow and q-bert are amazing in this terrific documentary check out just about every major dj crediting their getting in to scratch thanks to herbie hancock 's post-bop classic 'rockit and archival footage of some of the most complex and mind-blowing turntable routines of all time,1
dodgy plot dodgy script dodgy almost everything in fact the most compelling performance is that of joanna pacula as lauren but even that does not rescue this pointless and nasty film the director 's implicit invitation to viewers is not merely to suspend disbelief but to suspend judgement presumably it is intended to be steamy and menacing but although the film has its erotic moments they are few and far between this sort of thing has been done better by lots of others do n't go out of your way to see it,0
final solution is a powerful christian film that shows the hate between the black and whites that was present in the days of apartheid it shows how this hate was contrived and was groomed from generation to generation jan ellis was taught that a black man was a plague he was raised to be that way then he meets a man who is on the opposite side of his beliefs pastor lekota will he change his ways the film is a powerful movie that shows the perceptions the different races had for one another it shows these perceptions with quite a lot of accuracy the movie shows the world of how apartheid affected the psyche of blacks and whites this is a great film that everyone should watch,1
this show is the single greatest thing to come out of america since the simpsons not only does it have thousands of new ideas but it 's actually controversial see the jewish joke season 1 episode 1 and is n't scared to `` tick '' people off however the great minds at fox have canceled it along with greg the bunny and futurama so make sure you buy the season 1 box set while you still can it 'll be the best money you ever spend it 's definitely a show that gets better the more you watch it as at first the constant flashbacks can get a little annoying and do n't always seem to fit the story properly however after a couple of episodes you realise how brilliant it is and how well it compares to any other show currently on air at the moment,1
i thought the movie started out a bit slow and disjointed for the first hour however it became more absorbing fascinating and surprising in its last two hours so while it starts out like a cheap horror film it evolves into a beautiful and wonderful fantasy film bridget fonda stands out as the snow queen this was her best performance and it is sad that this apparently was her last performance as she has not acted in the last 7 years she absolutely personifies both the beauty and coldness of winter my daughter age 14 found the film a bit frightening so if you are showing it as family entertainment please stay with your child and reassure her or him that it is just a fairy tale fantasy and not to take it too seriously it is really one of the best fantasy films that i have seen in a long time slightly better than `` eragon '' or any of the `` lord of the rings '' it is about as good as `` the golden compass '',1
"have wanted to see this for a while i never thought i 'd be watching it in a damp trafalgar square london with 15,000 other people and all to a new score by the pet shop boys quickly that experience specifically a new departure from psb it seemed to suffer from the same problem the miniaturist hugo wolf had when he wrote his opera der corregidor the long structure was a chain of short ones i.e songs psb produced a more fluid integrated score although it was quite static on its own terms neither could they resist song a setting of the subtitled text worked in this respect a free standing meditation on the action of the odessa steps massacre during the action of that sequence itself was i 'd go so far to say counterproductive overall it was very exciting though which is surely what eisenstein was trying to achieve it is a very exciting film with choppier editing taking the place of acceleration of tension or action in fact the film though beautifully shot and passionately acted it has a silent film melodrama but not in the excess of the hollywood comic style breathes through its careful editing pacing specific shots with a sense of the rate at which the audience will take them in and there 's a huge range of perspective too either he had a lot of cameras or the sequences on the harbor and steps took a great deal of time super film which can be assessed irrespective of sound as that 's how the finished product would have been conceived 8/10",1
i have enjoyed both of the van dykes over the years and was glad to watch them again just as cute and funny and easy to watch and enjoy dick was good when he was younger but i enjoyed him more as he got older son berry has been a great one to follow in his fathers footsteps together they make a great team and work well together i am disappointed that i have not found another murder 101 listed anywhere i have seen both of the ones that have been shown i am hoping for more as it is really an enjoyable duo to watch you can sure tell berry follows in his dad footsteps they talk alike and have the same mannerisms would enjoy anything they do separately will be sure to watch anything they do alone and together,1
miyazaki 's studio ghibli shows his wonderful touch animating infusing life in every little action of the characters in ponyo when sosuke puts down so carefully his little boat to reach for the red fish you know that you 'll have a very good time watching this movie the characters are interesting and you really care for them they recall visually other stories riisa seems a grown up nausicaa with a son an old lady in wheelchair remembers the witch in howl 's moving castle the presence of the elements wind rain and the sea with its great powerful waves is so strong that i think it has never been evoked in such a way in any other movie it is a simple story loosely inspired by `` the little mermaid '' and it reach for the very heart of the audience just like totoro the other miyazaki 's true masterpiece an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits do n't miss it,1
a really terrible movie really low-budget with terrible acting a convoluted and inane plot a modest reworking of the vampire tales mixed with modern science the result is a total mess without meaning for most parts with very limited and cheap effects it is not even fun like several of the low budget independent movies of this kind a waste of time,0
i was waiting to welcome arnold schwarzeneger 's return to action after the dismal movies he 'd made after `` eraser '' `` end of days '' however can be added to the dismal films he 's had the misfortune of appearing in `` end of days '' starts well with a gripping action sequence yet quickly becomes a bore taking the focus off action and suspense and instead concentrating on the investigation of demonic happenings and the quickly approaching millenium read `` doomsday '' performances are stale special effects so-so and gore plentiful considering myself a die-hard schwarzenegger fan i could n't believe i did n't like this film but with such an awful lame script what could arnie have done besides passed on this turkey 3 out of 10,0
in all truth this really is n't a `` movie '' so much as an extended final episode by this i mean that had you not followed the tv series homicide life on the street i suspect that you would have a hard time following this made-for-tv movie having said that `` homicide the movie '' is still a great watch i think it says a lot about a television production that every single cast member would return many after years of absence to once again portray their characters and bring closure to an incredible program the movie brings out that sense of `` family '' not only amongst the characters but amongst the actors as well it 's all very bitter-sweet knowing that this will be the last time we will see them all together again under the title of homicide story-wise i found this film somewhat lacking giardello 's mayoral candidacy seems particularly contrived and i felt his shooting could 've been dealt with within the parameters of his regular position as leiutenant also det bayliss 's extreme plot twist which was left hanging at series end is finally resolved but i for one never felt that it needed to be i enjoyed being left with a mystery let us recall that the very first episode 's first case also went unsolved for the entire series run as a devoted fan of the tv series i can love this movie and the fact that it even got made after h lots had been canceled but i would not recommend it to anyone who has n't had the slightest exposure to the series now if they 'd just release it on dvd ...,1
i can never figure if this is the artiest soap opera ever produced or the soapiest art movie no matter john seale 's cinematogaphy is utterly ravishing ondaatje 's novel is not reduced but for once elevated to film if there is a fault it is in the original novel not in anthony minghella 's beautiful movie anyone who has a problem with it 's length almost certainly has not read the book and probably can not read i do not like repeating adjectives but ravishing serves the purpose apart from the storyline the players excel but it is the australian sense of light and shade that ultimately triumphs like some antipodean dutch master seale uses a blast of light where van rijn would have used shade one could weep for cinematography this magnificent,1
it 's a kinder gentler cyborg movie with a love story awww it 's not as bad as it sounds the action when it is there is decent and jack palance elias koteas and angelina jolie are always dependable it 's the fact that this is a sequel to the terrible jean claude van damme film or is that the capper to the masters of the universe trilogy i 'm still confused about that either way there was really no need for this movie what was there a need for angelina jolie she may play an assassin robot that can explodes mid-coitus but what a way to go and even though this is her first movie she still has the presence that made her an award winner,0
i remember disliking this movie the 1st time i saw it but it has grown on me i love the costumes and poses the actors make the humor the cinematography the soundtrack the scenes are very rich and it moves very quickly every time i watch it there is something new that catches my eye aaliyah as akasha is probably the only thing that ruins it but not enough also the lestat in this movie is different it is not the same character you can see that the character armand has been given lestat-like qualities because i 'm assuming anne wanted it in but there is no reason to trash this movie just because it 's not like books it 's a fascinating by itself,1
john candy was very much a hit-or-miss comic actor his death was a tragedy and we all miss him a lot but wagons east in which he plays a bumbling wagonmaster who agrees to take a group of pioneers out of the wild west is even sadder i do n't understand why it was even released the story is pointless and weak and the jokes are n't there it saddens me even further that candy 's last film would be his all-time worst movie so let 's forget all about this one and remember him in his better films such as summer rental planes trains and automobiles and uncle buck 0 out of 5,0
the seasoned actors in this do know how to act and have proved that before but the director who also wrote and produced this travesty is incompetent on so many levels o.k it 's low budget but i know films students with lower budgets and lesser known actors who can do much much better for example since there were people involved who should know better some of the gun rigs were totally out of place and never existed in those days the stunt work was clumsy the story stale and hokey if some one gives you a copy of this use it for a coaster by the way i love westerns and have known many stunt men and even went to high school with one of the actors so i was looking for it to be good,0
just a great soundtrack really enjoyable music outstanding cast great lead performance worth watching does n't really explain what happened to the neighborhood you are left feeling that integration is to blame or that with the departure of the lead character the neighborhood disintegrated this movie seems well researched and extremely well crafted i especially enjoyed some of the minor characters like jeffrey wright the cutting during the opening sequence helps express what a lively engaging and desirable experience that nightclub would have been with the jump music food drink dancing gambling and sex,1
i remember when i first heard about jack frost i was in video ezy at miranda with my family on a monthly video hiring tradition it was at this time that i worked up the courage to venture over towards the horror section of the store browsing the various titles i finally came across jack frost the cover was enough to convince me that the film was beyond my viewing pleasures years later the film disappeared only to be replaced with the inevitable yet unnecessary sequel i once again ventured to the horror section and picked up the case only to come to one conclusion the film would be scary but not intentionally jack frost 2 revenge of the killer mutant snowman quite a title follows off where it 's predecessor left it sheriff sam is seeking counseling after his ordeals and jack is now in the form of anti-freeze to escape his past sam and his wife head to an island hotel where he is in the company of a wide variety of slasher film stereotypes including busty female models thick headed sports jocks and caribbean staff however jack is released from his liquid grave and is back to his icy methods he heads over to the island and proceeds to kill anyone that would prove to have an awesome death only sam can stop him let me just say that this is a straight-to-video film so it 's bound to be bad but this is terrible even in the eyes of other over the top films the camera work is poor using a camera that would make a soap opera look majestic half the actors look like they 've come out of a porn shoot and the other half look like they 've come out of a retirement home but in actual fact they 've actually come out of an asylum there is an extensive use of special effects used in the film which tends to alternate between bland puppetry and cgi that can be bettered by an infant and the death scenes are mostly off screen showing us little of what has happened to the hapless yet deserving victims but the film is most memorable for it 's killer one liners such as `` there 's something that needs a little christmas stuffing '' and `` i know pronounce you officially f ing dead '' ultimately the whole purpose behind a film like this is to make a popcorn flick for those friday nights of boredom and even it fails at that to make a sequel to a film that was a poor slasher with a concept that a child would find unbelievable must 've taken some nerves of steel or a total frontal lobotomy to director michael cooney thanks for wasting my time to everyone else avoid like arsenic,0
i ca n't honestly believe that this is a sequel or follow up of john landis classic comedy horror movie from 1981 i suppose you ca n't really describe it as an original werewolf movie either since the bare bones of the story steal elements from the one set in london an american tourist visits a famous european capital he narrowly survives a werewolf attack that kills a colleague he embarks pardon the pun on a sexual relationship with someone in the medical profession he turns into a werewolf he 's visited by apparitions of his dead victims etc etc and reading the previous line i 've just discovered how much the storyline has in common with the original that it seems very similar indeed the difference lies in how enjoyable and entertaining the landis movie is with this paris based movie there 's no scenes that really stand out there 's no naked man waking up in a zoo wondering how he 's going to get back home with no money or clothes there 's no bizarre dream sequence of naziwerewolves and there 's no spectacular climax aawip does try to be funny but is there anything more embarrassing than failed humour i 'm thinking of the scene where andy mcdermott has to convince someone he 's got chewing gum in his pocket and not condoms perhaps the biggest difference between the two movies is that there 's no poignancy involved with this dubious follow up you really do feel sorry for the protagonist 's fate and dilemma in the london movie here you just feel andy is nothing more than a cypher going through the literary motions of a script there 's also a large number of plot holes visible is this the first time the lunar club have carried out a massacre if not then are n't large numbers of corpses with their hearts torn out been reported in the world 's press why have n't the police got leads everyone else has mentioned it and so will i the visuals are poor look at the bungee jumping scene at the eifell tower it 's painfully obvious that it 's achieved via some blue screen projection while the werewolf transformation is done by some very cartoonish cgi i wo n't put anthony waller in the same bracket as stephen sommers as a director who totally ruins a movie because of an over reliance on cgi the major problem with aawip is the screenplay coupled with a high degree of expectation from those who saw the 1981 movie classic but i would have preferred the rick baker type special effects used for the transformation to be fair it 's reasonable to speculate that perhaps the budget did n't stretch that far but at the end of the day this is a fairly poor horror movie that did n't need to be made and dog soldiers is much better entertainment,0
it must be a long time ago that i have seen such a bad movie i have to say it is really hard to make a good and/or realistic movie about air disaster but this movie was such a waste of time and money also i think this is an unofficial way trying to get a bad reputation on airbus first the cockpit look a lot like an airbus cockpit second you got a stick third using computers to control rudders/elevators/aileron via `` fly by wire '' when i saw this movie i thought like the intention of the film was `` do n't fly with computerized airplanes like airbus use boeing instead they have a direct connection of steering and rudders '' all i can say bad story horrible acting most of the actors worst film trick ever ...,0
i 've seen this movie twice already and am very impressed with it the conversations between nimi and her mother plus nimi and matthew are very touching the nigerian community is shown very truthfully and as colourfully as it usually is although certain things could have done with a bit more explanation if we knew why matthew was in the south of france in the first place the scenes following matthew being found in his car would be more understandable luckily optimum releasing have a website that has detailed production notes that help to make such scenes better to understand i would go and see it again but unfortunately it had a limited release in london and is not longer available to see i hope the video release gets it to a bigger audience because the film deserves it,1
in a time of predictable movies in which abound violence cheap romance and melodrama it is delightfully surprising to find such a strange movie the plot itself is compelling and the actors are excellent especially alan rickman if you want to watch a movie that does not provide all the answers before asking the questions a movie that will surprise you in good or bad dark harbor 's for you and if you 're not convinced believe me that alan rickman 's performance is well worth it ... especially at the end ladies ....,1
this is an extraordinary film as a courtroom drama it 's compelling as an indictment on the american justice system it 's frightening for brenton butler the consequences of this system could be devastating this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that it 's not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court in truth the implications of this case reach beyond the possibility of an innocent man being found guilty or a guilty man being free every citizen has a right to justice whether a perpetrator or a victim but do they get it the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries i 've seen,1
i love foreign films and this is among the best i tend to not see this as a comedy as it is listed and find it a commentary on how we see others around us firmine the lead in the film is not regarded must as she is a domestic in a large firm and people say and do things around her all the time that they otherwise would not say in front of others this leaves her with a bevy of information that can make or break the mere mortal this actress is wonderful as this character and it is a poignant tale there is an underlying tale and almost many stories within the story in this film i just hope that if someone does decide to make an american/english version of this film it is not the vein of three men and a baby that would definitely do a disservice to this film a must see .....,1
this is truly one of the most awful movies of all time it 's dull ponderous badly acted and teeth crawlingly pretentious i watched for about an hour waiting for some kind of drama to unfold before realising there was n't any the shot on a shoe string budget was particularly painful these have to be the worst day for night shots since plan nine from outer space the only barely redeeming feature is the ludicrous 'demons wandering around the countryside with a plastic cat basket how scary is that and i did like the moggys used as extras i suppose they are least cheap though it did seem a bit obvious that they had been enticed into camera by the careful placement of some tuna this film is so dreadful it should have a public health warning there was a queue at my local video store when i took it back of people demanding their money back i kid you not,0
i can not get over how awful this movie was my eyes want to jump out of my head and my ears are gushing blood from the horrible awful one song soundtrack there are four kids and dog and they run away from a hospital then get away with stealing two cars and a bus no one gives them any punishment or anything to correct them the acting is just so awful it sounds like an instruction video for social studies class i can not think of one thing that i like about this movie nothing even the kid that loses his dog made me want to vomit he gets his dog back without the lady even seeing the dog run out the door maybe the dog was trying to escape out of this movie then there is some horse manure in the whole mix it was torture watching this movie then at the end the oldest boy says something like staying together is n't a crime and they all hug him and love him stealing gas is a crime stealing two cars and a bus is a crime and he should have went to juvenile hall or something avoid this movie at all costs and especially if you want to keep your family together,0
dreadful film about a doctor who goes fishing and winds up catching a mermaid when he is thrown overboard she traps him into bringing her back with him glynis johns in the title role is really a silly individual with a tail hanging out margaret rutherford is the nurse who is supposed to be so eccentric but we see no eccentricity here in fact miss rutherford was not allowed to use her true comedic gifts nice to see david tomlinson in the film he would get together with johns in the far superior `` mary poppins '' 16 years later miranda causes mischief in that two guys a neighbor 's fiancée and chauffeur tomlinson fall for her ask any mermaid you happen to see what 's the best tuna chicken of the sea as for this film forget it,0
nana patekar once again proves that he is the best actor working in bombay without a doubt his recent movies involved shouting his lines that does not bode well for the theater trained thespian one wonders why he is always not given his accolades during awards season `` shakti-the power '' was one of his flicks that was an utter disapointment along with kohram a missed oppurtunity to create screen magic with amitabh bachchan but patekar exudes a cool calm in this film playing a cop on a sort of social justice journey ridding the streets of bombay of underworld dons in fake encounters patekars character takes control of the screen and the viewers attention and never lets go the editing is tightly paced and there are no annoying songs to distract from the story along the same lines as the modern day cult classic `` company '' the movie is well acted directed and should have a long shelf life on dvd the final ten minutes that see nana and the main villain talk at his offshore haven are bound to be part of hindi cinema classics wo n't be dissapointed with this cops and robbers flick,1
some people do n't appreciate the magical elements in ros but they are what sets this series apart that and the fact the producers actually decided to dress the actors in proper period clothes and armour -- not anachronistic feathered caps multi-coloured tights and plate armour but i am really writing to comment on an earlier poster 's article um michael praed did not leave ros to do jules verne there are 15 years between these two series yup i agree and michael might well agree too that leaving ros was not a good move -- but it was a coveted broadway role that tempted him in '84 and then dynasty with its megabucks paychecks ....,1
i unwittingly walked into this `` trap '' of a movie if i could turn back time or simply get a refund i would be happy it was 7:30pm and cinderella man did n't start until 10pm so i rushed into the theater to catch the movie that started at 7:20pm ... and i dare say god reached out his hand or retracted it and allowed me to punish myself for my film gluttony by sitting in for this film it may be unfair to criticize a movie that was not targeted at my heterosexual male cohort however there is no excuse for lousy sound and video editing this movie was at most worthy of a highschool project budget ... and i think i 've seen better in those play acting french shorts that we used to do about louis laloupe maybe it 's because i 'm canadian and this film was for the la fudge-packing crew and their sympathizing dames woe was me when i realized that then entire audience save me cracked up at all the jokes and entendres ... i fully understood the hinted humor ... but i just could not relate this show did show me supposedly how gay men date and build relationships however even if it was their purpose of the movie i feel that the `` gayness '' was focused on too heavily .... the humanity seemed lacking .... but again maybe that was the point ... simply to be avant-gard ... and to make a splash i guess with a low budget and poor equipment you have to make your movie as `` loud '' as possible in order to get crowds and cash return i really wish i had simply read my sheldon van auken instead hehe ... i was totally the wrong audience,0
steven seagal 's films of late have not exactly been good but this is by far the worst since the patriot the plot makes no sense what so ever it is never clear in what the relationships between the characters are who works for who or who is double crossing who the film is completely disjointed each scene seems to confuse the story further rather than carry it forward even the action sequences are uninspired and hard to follow most of the blame must lie at the director 's feet for not even understanding the basics of film making but seagal does not get off lightly as one of the producers of this film he must also share the blame oh and i have n't even mentioned how awful the acting is even by seagal standards even as straight to video fodder this is not worth a view even for seagal fans give it a wide berth,0
had the league been unknowns pitching this script the backers would simply have turned around and said `` no you 're not having the money this is dreadful '' as a fan of the league of gentlemen this is their poorest outing to date not particularly funny not particularly entertaining there are few laugh out loud moments they do exist but they are few and far between i felt the format was tired and really dragging the film refers to the writers being bored of the characters and it shows as for being a film i felt the xmas special had better production value the fx are generally pretty poor and it is clearly obvious that they did n't film in the original royston vasey they filmed this on the cheap in ireland the musical score is weak and the dialogue is terrible also the accents of the characters were largely off from their tv equivalents tubs and edward much underused again just did n't sound like themselves disappointing really because i was hoping for something far more entertaining this really was the league 's equivalent of the 1970s comedies where the cast go to spain ...,0
this film is a very beautiful and slow film there is nothing hollywood about it it is very danish and the characters are very real it is the first danish film to take up this transsexual theme it is really about love that has no gender i would not say it is about lesbian love even though the two main characters the transsexual veronika and charlotte are attracted to each other it is a story about love and life the story pretty much takes place in the two apartments there is almost no background music which makes it seem more real and intense the two actors playing the main characters are great they really make them seem real they are not archetypes but real people you could meet in the street i think it is the first time i have seen a transsexual portrayed this well very well done,1
i was actually looking forward to this movie the commercials made it look real cool and action packed and i heard that claire daines character was arrested for assault so i thought that maybe she would kick a lot of ass and that would be cool but noooooooo their was hardly any action at all and the character were all kinda bland the only saving grace was omar epps and even he did n't help this movie much,0
when i went to see this documentary on communist bloc musicals i was expecting something totally demented along the lines of a communist `` cop rock '' some scenes did deliver including a rousing clip from a soviet film called `` tractor drivers '' you 'd think that moviemakers given the task of making ideologically correct musicals that sing dance and espouse the party line face insurmountable odds and yet one of the surprises of `` east side story '' is that some of the films presented actually looked promising one was a mid-1950s east german effort called `` my wife wants to sing '' in which as the title implies an unhappy hausfrau seeks to launch a singing career over the objections of her traditionally-minded husband another genuinely interesting-looking movie also from east germany was called `` midnight revue '' in this film-within-a-film the producers spoof their own creative plight with the story of a group of filmmakers under party orders to make a musical the on-screen filmmakers themselves get to do a musical number about avoiding `` too hot '' subjects very reminiscent in tone of the 1957 movie `` silk stockings '' the documentary is marred by somewhat insipid narration but it 's still a lot of fun to watch look for the closing dedication to the person who made it all possible,1
this show started out okay but then it turned into a nightmare the worst part about it was the contestants most of them were weirdos they did stupid things for a living and they also did strange hobbies in the second season one guy said he that he talked to his pants that is sick and repulsive also no one cared about winning money all they ever wanted to do was make alliances like it was `` survivor '' or something the men were always afraid that the women were going to team up together the women were the same also i just could n't take it anymore i had to stop watching it it was truly one of the worst shows ever,0
this epic brings together a superbly-gifted cast and crew a narrative depth superior to most novels wonderful music philosophy and a connection to life that i find difficult to explain to immerse oneself in die zweite heimat is for me akin to a spiritual experience similar to the awe one gets when looking at the stars in a clear night sky the language and use of both colour and monochrome segments adds to the dramatic impact the film inspired me to go to munich and visit some of the locations including the edgar reitz office from then on i vowed to improve my german skills after die zweite heimat i feel almost german as if i am in the head of the characters i also try to match the piano playing of henry arnold hermann but this is the one thing that will always elude me this drama is unparalleled and i have been fortunate to see it on bbc2 in the uk and sbs in australia the sequel heimat 3 is currently being filmed in germany,1
written by directed by and starring the champ of camp bruce campbell easy on its easy to tell this is a budget on a shoestring affair filmed independently in bulgaria all i can really say for sure is that silly is not always funny campbell plays an affluent american business man with a cheating wife antoinette byron and trying to close a business transaction before he is murdered he hires a cabbie to drive him around a strange little town not knowing that his wife is 'carrying on with the taxi driver within moments of campbell being bludgeoned the cabbie is killed in the same location a mad scientist stacy keach proceeds with an experiment putting the cabbie 's brain inside the american 's head with massive stitches on his forehead campbell breaks free and roams the streets looking for his wife all the while he is arguing with a strange voice inside his over-sized head campbell contorts his rubbery face making silly expressions as he argues with himself thus bruce is doing what he does best and no doubt his many fans will be pleased i get the impression this must have been written as a straight comedy rounding out the cast are ted raimi tamara gorski and vladmir kolev watch for this on the sci-fi channel,0
okay this was n't the greatest horror movie i 've ever seen in my life despite the fact that it 's lower budget it 's a pretty decent movie though the monsters are unique and believable heck they 're even kind of scary in the scenes where they show them briefly wreaking havoc on this poor family although when you finally do get to see the monsters completely you really think `` wtf those itty bitty things are after them '' the only part that really disturbed me is when sniff they killed the kitty not the kitty noooooo why seriously though if you are looking for hardcore violence and gore this is not the movie for you go rent the hills have eyes or something along those lines if you have small children i would n't recommend watching this with them though probably would give them nightmares about trolls in their room,1
from the epicenter of the cultural globe four working class teenagers attempted to change the world through music and fashion it was the final attempt to do so last century and they failed before the dust had cleared band manager and sex shop proprietor malcolm mclaren spent the money the sex pistols had earned to make a `` mockumentary '' about his own role in their success the film was called the great rock 'n roll swindle take the hint and consists of very little footage of the sex pistols actually playing music and quite a lot of footage of mclaren effectively calling the audience idiots cod-surrealist nonsense in which guitarist steve jones is a detective on mclaren 's tail soon dissolves so he and drummer paul cook can jet off to rio and spend time with `` great train robber '' ronnie biggs ready yourself for the spectacle of three very unappealing men dancing naked to a hideous irony-free version of `` belsen was a gas '' a song about killing jews for gold in bergen-belsen concentration camp and another song sung in ronnie 's tone deaf whine which includes the lyrics `` god save myra hindley god save ian brady '' lyrics that johnny rotten would have considered distasteful the sid vicious scenes are few and idiotic jumping out of bed in a thong with a swastika over the testicles to sing some bad boy biker song from the '50s playing into to the `` punk 's a joke '' theme of the movie in an attempt to turn sid into james dean i 'm surprised mclaren does n't take credit for siddy 's death too the redeeming scenes are those of sid in paris and the infamous performance of my way the punk rock zeitgeist right there mocking an adoring audience before shooting them all no need for an entire film just watch that clip on youtube from julien temple 's far superior and more enjoyable 2001 documentary followup the filth and the fury we were given a more balanced/honest view of what transpired in '78 but there were also a number of scenes that i would have liked to have seen in swindle as fury was basically a reediting of the same material one was an animated sid complete with sid 's voice acting `` you f cken betta wat'ch out alright or i 'll slice you open '' a still of which appeared on the cover of the something else 7 inch a snippet was shown in fury but i do n't know what context that originally appeared was it in original prints but removed after sid 's death was there more fury also shed light on the film who killed bambi which would have been the mock hard day 's night movie mclaren was originally intending to make it starred sting as a member of a gay new romantics group and looked a damn sight more entertaining than swindle sod swindle t'is a swindle if you must rent the filth and the fury and revel in music 's failure as a world changing polemic,0
... but i laughed a lot i saw 'astérix et les vikings at a public screening during the world cup the sound was lousy it was too bright to see the screen properly but i still enjoyed myself immensely the names of some of the characters had me rolling on the floor smsix abba vikea ... all not very witty but in good astérix tradition some very good jokes but also some that not everybody seemed to get the only thing i did n't like were the voices of astérix and obélix in the german version at least the voice actors are very well-known around here which was the only reason they were casted really they do n't fit the characters at all all in all a good way to spend some time and if it 's free like in my case all the better and to have a couple of laughs 8 out of 10,1
there were but two reasons for me to see this film first of all stellan skarsgard and marisa tomei were in it who are both good actors and i had nothing better to do while seeing the film though i immediately thought of something better to do sleep this film is a complete waste of time it is a standard ex-cop flick the ex-copper is the best there ever was but he was fired he keeps doing stuff on his own to the dislike of his former buddies and he saves the day all big surprises not go to sleep or if you have insomnia try this one 4 out of 10,0
i 've enjoyed watching lost from the beginning and endured a few bad actors in poorly written episodes because when lost is good it 's really good but this episode that features mr echos demise had so many drawn out scenes with lingering closeups of bad acting that i found myself tapping the fast forward button this episode stood out so far as by far the worst in fact the variation in quality of lost has been so inconsistent i find myself often wondering how many writers they are using i will continue to watch but hope things get better and hope i stop secretly wishing for the sub-par actors in the series to die off,0
it 's funny ... one day before i have seen this movie i had been watching a documentary about leni riefenstahl so comparison kind of came automatically ... of course there is n't any this movie is weak in every aspect ... acting is not convincing especially the one who plays simona ... and unnatural ... editing in confused and always leaves a taste of unfinished shot music does n't fit the story does n't flow it gets boring and the movie comes out much longer as it is ... oh and the characters are n't very well shown you actually ca n't tell much about the girls except what you see ... the movie also tries to shock with explicit cursing which is very laughable so ... 2/10,0
for those of you unfamiliar with alisdair sims he is of course the definitive scrooge of all them christmas carol movies me i guess i 'm really bad .. i have n't actually seen the darn thing i guess those who have seen christmas carol and so used to his character might find the bells of st. trinians rather surprising you see in this movie sims has two roles one he plays a heavy better and in the other he 's in drag as a headmistress for a private girl 's school so once you get that through your thick skull this movie offers plenty of delights the plot is deals with the way the school tries to make some desperately needed money through a horse race it 's actually a little more complicated for the small kids to handle but i think they would be preoccupied with their antics and with the horses to really notice the adults too might get tripped over all the thick accents being thrown around as well but again the story is reasonably light the action crazy and frenetic for one to really notice ps the kids all look like they come from the eloise school of cuteness,1
this movie was pure genius john waters is brilliant it is hilarious and i am not sick of it even after seeing it about 20 times since i bought it a few months ago the acting is great although ricki lake could have been better and johnny depp is magnificent he is such a beautiful man and a very talented actor and seeing most of johnny 's movies this is probably my favorite i give it 9.5/10 rent it today,0
well you know ... rutger hauer and robert patrick both are really good actors but wtf with this movie the story was lame and the script was just terrible the poor actors did n't have material to work with the dvd cover invited you to a flight action flick you would expect something like top gun ... huge disappointment the flight action in this movie is so cheap that makes you puke the aerial scenes are clearly taken from documentaries and some other footage sources not made for this movie and they did n't even care about the marks or the fighters models taking for granted the audience will not notice it as i said the story was lame with a little effort from the writer and director it could have been very interesting in short it seems a b-movie made in the 70 's i feel very sorry for these actors who put their names here they sure must be ashamed,0
in a better civilization this and many other of the david suchet movies would be released in theaters the plots are fabulous no i 'd no clue who had done it but the clues were all there if i 'd been more imaginative the best kind of mystery the production values astounding the acting from edward fox sarah miles lysette anthony megan dodds and of course david suchet as hercule poirot simply perfect the dialogue wonderful the music and sens of suspense and tension just wonderful stuff one of the pleasures of these hercule poirot movies for a man is how many beautiful women star in them here were have two the sexy sinuous megan doods and the stunning lysette anthony you really ca n't go wrong renting these they 're just wonderful like the most wonderful dinner in the most wonderful restaurant with the most perfect company you can imagine your mind constantly working because it 's all there and you struggle but by keeping your mind constantly thinking can keep up with everything and the settings gorgeous i ca n't think of movies that stimulate thought more than these hercule poirot/david suchet movies it 's impossible to over-praise them and i had never seen one before a few months ago nor read an agatha christie,1
this is one of the most stupid and worthless movies ever it really does not qualify for movie status it is very cheap apparently shot on videotape horribly acted and just plain rotten i could not believe how cheap and inept this piece of crap was it looked like a home video i mean i believe a guy i know a few houses down must have dug out his video camera and made this crap in 2 or 3 hours it is that bad i noticed the name from whence this came asylum and i will never rent anything with that name on it again when you rent a flick check to see if it is from this `` company '' one thing is true though -- if you like horribly acted amateur movies then you might like this loser it is absolutely boring and terrible you have been warned,0

meh sums it all up for me really boring story bland dialogue dull action scenes how do you make something like a fight or a shootout boring do you actually have to try to do that no real characters etc just dull snipes is a gifted actor and physical performer but none of this has come to the surface in any of his dtv work when the opportunity is there to give the audience a much more superior product than they are used to imagine a decent script with a few solid characters that you care about and some damn explosive action fights shootouts etc how can it be that hard to handle my personal opinion is that the primary players in the productions simply do not care there is no evidence of enthusiasm for what they are doing look at snipes in the first 2 blades passenger 57 rising sun new jack city demolition man etc awesome intense performances complemented by decent if not always outstanding scripts good supporting casts and wicked action none of that is evident in any of these releases so far which is a tremendous shame the distributors slap wesley 's face on the cover knowing the audience will lap them up as they have n't realised yet that they have n't seen him in theatres for nearly 2 years i 'd love to see snipes work with somebody like isaac florentine who really knows how to make the most out of a dtv production and work with alpha stunts who are simply some of the best action guys out there together they would all make an awesome team and a snipes action vehicle we would all be proud of seeing detonator sucks it 's not as bad as the marksman which chews but it still really sucks,0
from the director of oldboy comes this slick vampire flick kang-ho song stars as a priest who is accidentally changed into a vampire while being cured of a deadly mysterious virus his vampirism and priesthood are quite at conflict but he is able to survive by robbing the hospital 's blood bank and unconscious patients who might not mind some siphoned blood because of his supposedly miraculous survival he comes into the lives of ha-kyun shin 's family shin has cancer and his mother believes that song can cure it unfortunately song 's vampirism raises his levels of lust to a height where he ca n't help but fall for shin 's young wife ok-vin kim kim is intensely interested in the world of vampirism and the two become lovers the film from there goes in weird directions that i think one should experience for themselves what really should be mentioned is chan-wook park 's mastery of the medium of cinema my god i 've rarely seen such a masterful visual artist at the peak of his powers the major flaw of the film is that it 's a little incoherent especially near the beginning park is interested in telling his stories mostly in the visuals which can be difficult to follow at times but when it works man does it fly the film is also perversely hilarious the final sequence easily one of the best of the decade is simultaneously heartbreaking and delightfully ridiculous ok-vin kim should become a worldwide star after this film she gives one of the best performances of the year,1
the `` hunting trilogy '' of rabbit fire 1951 rabbit seasoning 1952 and duck rabbit duck 1953 should be considered the comedic high water mark of the chuck jones-michael maltese collaboration while they are seldom mentioned in lists of the `` greatest '' or `` most important '' cartoons in the history of animation they are certainly the funniest cartoons i 've ever seen michael maltese never got the credit that directors like jones freleng or avery got but it 's his dialogue and situations that make warner bros. cartoons and these three in particular some of the funniest ever made,1
having seen and loved this film in australia i was very keen to get me paws on a copy i got one on dvd back in the uk only to find that it 's a very different edit the domestic australain edit i saw is snappier the uk and i presume european edits spends a lot longer on the narrator played by jimmy 's dead brother.and in truth belabours that and few other points to no real benefit it is not a serious criticism but the oz edit is just brisker and i think more assured i ca n't say why they felt it needed expansion for the overseas market so careful about which one you go for i went for both,1
i saw this on a screener dvd a couple months before it was released i liked the main characters and the overall story but some scenes are pretty sloppy and confusing the sets were fitting but a few just looked like left overs from freaks geeks or reminded me of a cell phone commercial shot in a middle class home definitely not what the dvd cover claims `` destined to be the next stoner classic '' hardly wardrobe and hairstyles are done well and yes there are some really pretty girls in this always nice to see a good looking cast almost every scene contained guitar that just droned on and on sound design was a bit poor i think less would have been best,0
bad acting combats are very awful 3-4 second between each text bad music bad effect and always the same plan during the movie if you want laugh go it 2/10 for the fool laugh,0
this is a failure so complete as to make me angry all of the subtlety and structure of reggio 's early films is gone leaving nothing but a hash of digitally smeared images whose sole purpose seems to be whining about bad things humans do just how do star trek-like wormhole graphics slo-mo colorized seascapes mutiplicities of obviously fake computer icons and shots of athletic competition that incidentally show that no one has ever been able to top or even match leni riefenstahl for filming bodies in motion edited together with an overlay of video colorization that a 1980s `` dr. who '' producer would have rejected as `` too cheesy '' add up to a polemic against `` civilized violence '' there is no intellectual emotional or visceral connection between these images as assembled and mutated by reggio and way too many digital effects artistes and the cautionary tale i assume he wanted to produce with all of the `` dramaturgical consultants '' involved no one seems to have pulled his head out the his own feeling of saying something important and considered that they might all be failing to say something new only people who watch too much television could make such a film and believe that it 's meaningful this is kindergarten stan brakhage and ultimately gutless in its relentless obviousness the only irony and tension evident here unlike in `` koyaanisqatsi '' where the relentless beauty and strangeness of time-altered ordinary images forced you to consider their meaning was when the dvd i was watching jammed and skipped this is mtv for the noam chomsky crowd based on reflex rather than reflection and signifying nothing two stars for the music which is in glass 's best pomo-cesar franck style and features some passionate cello from yo-yo ma i hope for his sake that he did n't have to record his parts to a playback of the film there are some things you should n't have to do even for a paycheck,0
excellent entry in the rko saint series with well-written original script good camera work and transitions good directing to handle some twists in the plot good editing to keep the flow constant and good acting george sanders is suave and witty jonathan hale simply is inspector fernack paul guilfoyle plays a mobster who goes straight and drinks milk because he can not take the pressure he will return in a later entry in the series story begins on an ocean liner headed to the u.s. where the saint meets but can not connect with wendie barrie she eventually succumbs to the saint 's charms but she breaks his heart in the end the saint assists inspector fernack clear his name from a frame a few bodies fall along the way good entertainment and above average for this type of film watch it,1
this movie has everything it has a good storyline good acting great scenery adventure and some brilliant gags chris farley plays tommy callaghanhe mega successful company 'callaghan auto parts has to go on the road to stop the company going under after big tom dies the trouble is that tommy knows nothing about break pads and needs the help of callaghan auto parts worker richard david spade from the moment the two dorks hit the road the movie is just so much fun if you love slapstick with a great storyline you 'll love this because the gags keep coming thick and fast and the movie will just make you laugh out loud it was so sad about farley 's untimely death in 1997 but a credit to his genius is 'tommy boy get it chill out and enjoy this brilliant slapstick,1
i was supremely disappointed with this one having just read the wonderful oscar wilde story i had hoped for at least a little of the magic to translate onto the screen well there was none this version played like a condensed dumbed down reader 's digest movie not only did it feel rushed it was cheapened and needlessly re written major characters and plot points were either changed or completely removed i appreciate the difficulties in trying to bring a novel to the screen especially on what may very well have been a limited tv budget but there is no excuse for mangling a great story in this way i thoroughly recommend reading wilde 's tale of the depravity that exists under even the most beautiful exteriors but i can not advise anyone to rent this travesty,0
tony curtis and skip homier both are wearing black with white trim canvas shoes in the scenes just before and after the swimming pond and the tank being blown up must have been too hard on the young stars feet.if the real marines had been on the mission they would have been wearing boots in the first scenes they took off their leggin 's just before starting out on their little trip to find the farmer when they went to the area where they dug the fox holes tony and skip are wearing combat boots then later when lovejoy and curtis run into the framer and his daughter tony is wearing the `` tennis shoes `` but hey have been blacken the movie in about a true story but did they really need the love interest,0
while i score the movie a 7 i also should point out that it is both interesting historically as it stars mae marsh lillian gish and lionel barrymore when they were all younger and less well-known and features pretty exciting action for its day the plot is odd for a western in that all the trouble with the indians begins for the weirdest reason i have ever seen the indians decide to have a giant dog banquet no they are not feeding dogs but feeding on dogs and when two indians arrive late there are not pooches left so they steal two dogs belonging to two orphans from the nearby white settlement and this actually touches off an all-out war not only is this silly but seems to play on the prejudices of audiences i do n't know if american indians actually ate dog but it sounds like the sort of stereotype that later was applied to other ethnic groups all this over dogs the movie has some excellent battle scenes and exciting moments -- such as when ms. marsh crawls across the battlefield to save a baby exciting stuff but strange too,1
"i do n't know what dick steel was talking about but i found this film to be one of japan 's most thrilling epics to date as for armageddon or deep impact or for that matter the day after tomorrow is pale in comparison for what i know of films most of the catastrophes in films are basically run of the mill asteroid flicks or one of which of global warming this how ever ran a different course a course of natural means where the earth 's crust is beginning to erode to such a degree that it will take another piece of land with it for the ride what the scientific teams had to do was create a way to stop the erosion from going to far and sinking japan altogether in most cases this would simply be called tectonic shifting on steroids i found the characters rather appealing in every way from the child who lost her mother only to face her own demise among unfamiliar friends or the rescue girl who does all the she can to save lives in the face of disaster or a man who thought he could change her mind not to be such a dare devil and go with him to safety only to become the hero himself and save his homeland and let 's not forget how the rest of the world just shucked them all back only to be forgotten by having the world turning their backs on the japanese citizens who cried for help this was a great movie in all aspects what dick is trying to say is that this movie was not hollywood made that it was made in japan that it had characters which rival other actors around the world that the effects are very gorgeous as he mentioned but it 's all he was waiting for and nothing else he lacks the vision of what 's important to everyone and why this film had every element of feeling of grandeur and of humanity i thought this film was top rate and i have seen many disaster films to know that japan sinks was possibly one of the most original and well thought out projects i have witnessed i really hope shinji higuchi will make another of such films oh and by the way i am not japanese though in many ways i wish i was i am canadian born and raised and an avid movie buff in all aspects predjudicial visions are bitter and not worth the effort to be recognized as an opinion dick you should watch it with a more open heart and mind do n't just look for the eye candy which makes a films content look for what 's more important and understand it they may not be american but the japanese have cornered the market lately for some of the most breath taking and down right gritty film making to date which is why spending 25,000,000 is just what the doctor ordered you heard right 25,000,000 to make this film now you tell me was it worth it or was it worth it because american actors were n't in it",1
dude ... i liked buffy and angel as much as the next sci-fi freak ... but this is too much the worst lead actress ever not even david `` hot pants '' boreanaz is able to save this crap no wonder i never watch fox  it blows we totally gave it a chance and it continued to suck we watched four or five painful agonizing episodes i want to kill the execs at the network so bad why is money being spent on this drivel i do n't get it and i do n't support it and you should never waste your time watching this show ... unless you like it when your eyes bleed from their sockets crap crap crap,0
it 's about jealousy it 's about racism it 's about manipulation but the underlying message is love geoffrey sax tried to pull off shakespeare 's othello by bringing it to modern day context however the actors were not convincing enough to pull this off there were extra bodies to help put everything in to perspective however john othello played by eamonn walker over reacted a lot in this film causing for the down fall of keeley hawes dessie brabant eventually ending in dessie 's death ben jago played by christopher eccleston was seen as the main character in the film he did n't give enough evidence for dessie to be cheating on othello with michael cass played by richard coyle instead he just played a friend to all and gave one reason as to why she `` was '' cheating in the play it took a lot more convincing from iago to make othello even suspect anything this change made the movie more about rage for the wrong reasons than what the book was based off of however the movie did have a few good points it turned the army scenes into more a racist group toward blacks where othello is the main chief of the police squad these scenes are made believable by the raging crowds and burning fires you are able to sense the amount of racism in the movie more so than you can in the book this book plays up the modern day scenes by making it much easier to understand than the shakespearian times it was written in in the play iago jago gets tortured at the end but in the film he gets his satisfaction and gets othello 's position he never gets what he deserves and is never caught for telling the lie to othello until it is too late i saw this as a downfall in the movie because i feel that the villain is granted his treasure of the promotion out of lying and in the book he is found out by rodrigo overall the movie could have done a better job based on the play than what it did i feel that the director of the movie left out some of the most important parts of the play that were mentioned or there to make the play flow or make it more of a tragedy i would say that you should read the book first in order to understand all of the events that happened in the movie otherwise you may find yourself lost and confused,0
seriously i could n't find anything that constituted a rational human thought in this movie for some reason the writer decided to have a bunch of actors in random places grunting groveling and yelling like cro-magnon bipeds i understand that this was about gymnastics but seriously what 's with all the roaring and human bleating i also saw at least five actors with overactive terrets syndrome and stage 10 syphilis although this movie has actual human acrobatics i must say it is surprising that you can make a movie like this without having any intelligible form of human speech patterns this is truly a milestone in the history of film-making because there was no conscious decision to make the characters express anything more than a timely urrrrr or rfff sound incredible,0
obviously this is not the `` piranha '' directed by joe dante and produced by roger corman it was n't so obvious when i bought the dvd for only 2.95 as the dvd cover art matched that of the corman produced comedy/horror `` piranha '' even the dvd menu no features of course matched the cover half way through watching this odd movie my girlfriend and i started thinking where are the piranhas once the movie reached the climax we realised that we must have been watching the wrong movie as we had seen the trailer which had completely different footage the blurb on the back of the dvd did not match the story we were watching and the credits actors producer director were also completely different instead we got some jungle melodrama about a a girl and two guys who go searching for diamonds and end up confronting a vicious animal hunter this tame exploitation thriller is boring and pointless and is only mildly amusing for old-school camp value strange that a dvd can be manufactured with the wrong film in tact but i suppose it is an easy mistake to make seeing as though they are both b-grade movies of the same name made in the 70 's reading other posts made on this film i noticed that i 'm not the only one with the wrong movie on the dvd how could this be an international error is there perhaps some sort of dvd phenomena where unsuccessful films try to get recognition by being put on the wrong dvds what is going on,0
here be spoilers recap macleane miller witnesses a robbery by plunkett carlyle that goes wrong plunkett 's partner get shot and killed but not until after he has swallowed a great ruby plunkett and macleane then meet at the cemetery when both try to get hold of the ruby unfortunately they are caught as grave robbers and sent to jail but not until plunkett has swallowed the ruby the ruby is their key to freedom and once they 're free they form a partnership in robbery macleane is to pose as a gentleman and find out who is worth robbing and then simply they rob him and rob them in style but macleane falls in love with the niece/daughter of their first victim lady rebecca gibson tyler and a mr chance stott is out to catch them and his methods are not very nice ... comments a good action flavoured by comedy and adventure carlyle and miller form a good team with a lot of friction and friendship and then there is the relationship between macleane and rebecca gibson the scene with the ball is very good especially the anachronistic use of the music in addition to these interesting characters cumming play the best of them all lord rochester both the character and the acting are stellar and among the best in the movie in total the movie works very well a nice balance between story and special effects action and comedy very entertaining 8/10,1
this movie does n't even have the saving grace of being so bad that its good it is truly appalling its closer to a tongue-in-cheek parody than a disaster movie but alas they were serious made for tv but not worthy of even that it contains every cliché and cheesy plot moment you can imagine oh will he save the town from the flood will his wife admit that she still loves him will they escape before the flood drowns them i cant explain how bad this is awful predictable plot that makes you wince it is so cheesy bad effects although to be fair i have seen worse super-imposed bubbling water bad script woeful acting hideous so bad in fact that you probably should get drunk and watch it,0
i sort of liked this columbo movie its atmosphere which was real thriller like and its approach even at times reminded me of film-noir in the movie its first 30 minutes or so it 's really nice and done in a good old fashioned way with the right camera angles and use of light it does n't mean instantly that this movie is a brilliant one though but its solid enough to consider this a good late columbo movie entry it 's definitely a better movie than the average 'later columbo movie entry 26 years after his previous columbo movie appearance george hamilton returns once again to play the main lead opposite peter falk again as the murderer in a total different and new role of course i liked him in his role and he was a good columbo 'villain who gave the good old lieutenant some good competition they had some nice sequences together problem with the 'modern new columbo movies always sort of had been that it did n't feature a good well known actor opposite peter falk this movie obviously does n't suffer from this problem but i must say though that this movie does n't feature peter falk at this best he has certainly played the character better and his performance is n't quite consistent enough within this movie which is probably also due to he movie its director daryl duke who also directed the really dreadful movie `` tai-pan '' among many other projects it has a rather good and enjoyable story but the fact that the same sort of plot to cover up the murder had been used before in an earlier columbo movie also does n't help of course it got used before in the 1975 movie `` columbo playback '' nevertheless it of course also still has plenty enough 'original moments of its own with its story even though of course in essence every columbo movie is more or less the same but oh well that is what made the columbo series so great and consistent if it ai n't broke do n't fix it it also is true that within this movie more clues than usual are left out for the lieutenant which does n't mean that the movie its murderer is more stupid or sloppy but i more see it as the writers being more overly enthusiastic than others it does n't make the movie or story bad and it in fact perhaps even makes it more enjoyable to see columbo hard at work and discovering all kind of small but important clues luckily the movie is also filled with some enjoyable effective relieving columbo-comedy simply a good late columbo movie entry 7/10,1
movies like this give independent films a bad name this simply a boring compilation of vingettes with no structure whatsoever i would n't be surprised if the screenwriter was completely stoned if you want to see a good stoner comedy watch `` half baked '' it 's no award-winner but at least it made me laugh the film was obviously made on a micro-budget every scene either takes place in someone 's house someone 's apartment or some outdoor location if the writing was good and the dialogue was interesting i would 've ignored the film 's budget like in the case of edward burns films but obviously that 's not the case this time around i quote robert deniro from `` a bronx tale '' when i say `` there 's nothing in the world worse than wasted talent '' everybody in the cast is talented luke wilson alicia witt brittany murphy jeremy sisto -- all talented performers and they all have been in much better movies the actors give it their all but they could n't go too far with such a lame script the only scene i found interesting was jack black 's cameo where he sings a song about being in the woods and of course there was the brief strip club scene at the beginning which i also found appealing the characters are uninteresting and the story barely exists many movies are awful but at least you understand their intentions what was `` bongwater 's '' intention the world will never know my score 2 out of 10,0
a delightful and wonderful film which has entered my pantheon of great romantic comedies in many ways it 's even better than `` when harry met sally '' it wears well on viewing and re-viewing the cast is excellent and both david duchovny and minnie driver give us really believable characters,1
this movie turned out to be pretty much what i expected of course it 's sappy of course it 's predictable we all know the fairytale but knowing that when you go to watch it it 's enjoyable enough to watch it was funny and sweet i did find it annoying that they showed geeks as either kids who did n't wash there hair or kids who loved math and joined clubs about math and wore t-shirts about math i was an outcast in high school and i did n't do these things it goes much deeper than that having to do with many things some of that being how much money your family has how much you are willing to hide your uniqueness and how mean you are willing to be to other kids anyway i wo n't get into it i do n't agree with other opinions that drew is n't convincing as a geek with braces no make-up and unwashed hair i do n't think too many people would be drooling over her and even when she goes back to high-school and sheds those things she 's still wearing the `` wrong '' clothes `` wrong '' hair and has the `` wrong '' attitude to be considered cool and her other `` geek '' friend may be beautiful but it does n't matter where i come from you can still be an outcast and be beautiful inside and out,1
i am a german student so sorry for eventually mistakes i 'm working on it the stylistic very interesting converted and with effective sound effects accentuated platitudinous action of the drama deflect in no way from the horrible bad actors insincere and unnatural moves and expressions of feelings and makes so the relatively weird and senseless story less better just the typical slasher-genre with in this case very odd action many by-plays destroy partly the main story and let the viewers up to the end into the dark create weirdness and let surmise the senses of actions and the point mere hazily for sure its an hit for slasher-fans but not for me but although the interesting style of cinematography and adeptly use of light is turned out well so not the best one ...,0
hayao miyazaki has captured the imagination of audiences young and old across the globe and his most recent cinematic work of art is `` ponyo '' a children 's fairytale borrowing on story elements from the little mermaid of course like other miyazaki classics such as `` spirited away '' and his last film `` howl 's moving castle '' `` ponyo '' is full of a creativity that can only be truly appreciated by adults but this it is distinctly more a children 's story than those recent efforts it 's a magical story best described as beautiful and lovable aiming for charm instead of conflict `` ponyo '' is the story of a bug-eyed childish-looking fish of the same name the daughter of an undersea sorcerer who longs to escape the sea and become a little girl when she does she quickly befriends a young boy named sosuke in the process she gains a strong magic and unknowingly throws the world out of balance between land and sea and a giant storm drowns most of the cliff-top town where sosuke lives with his mother and it threatens to end the world like `` howl 's moving castle '' walt disney picked up `` ponyo '' for an american release and dubbed it over with an impressive selection of western voices even choosing homegrown products in the youngest siblings of disney band the jonas brothers frankie jonas and miley cyrus younger sister noah to voice sosuke and ponyo respectively also voicing characters are liam neeson fujimoto ponyo 's father tina fey lisa sosuke 's mother matt damon sosuke 's father cate blanchett ponyo 's sea goddess mother and a trio of hilarious elderly women are played by betty white cloris leachman and lily tomlin the effort is definitely there to make this film appeal to american audiences and disney is getting close but voices are of little significance in a miyazaki film which is all about visual creativity a fan of transformations and animating liquid and fluid motion creating a fairytale taking place partly underwater must 've been a joy for miyazaki to work with and maybe even his entire motivation for choosing this story among the highlights are droplets of water that fujimoto sends after ponyo that move like living waves as well as a variety of other magnificent sea creatures and breathtaking storm scenes make `` ponyo '' as awing as any other miyazaki film as a children 's story however `` ponyo '' concentrates its efforts on being adorable the discovery of true friendship and love between sosuke and ponyo is heart-warming even if noah cyrus shouting childishly when ponyo excitedly embraces human life can get a bit annoying but as delightful as many of the imaginative elements and loving relationships are there 's very little antagonism or danger past miyazaki films have clear villains but the conflict in `` ponyo '' actually shrinks as the story goes along sosuke believes he 's lost his mother at one point and in the background is the idea of the world going out of whack and that humans should be ashamed of polluting the sea but `` ponyo '' is mostly tension free most glaringly its climax is uneventful despite how overall likable all the characters are `` ponyo '' will surely satisfy miyazaki 's fans in every way with its imagination and newcomers will still be smitten by his simple yet visually ambitious storytelling but this is distinctly more of a children 's movie best for families and others who love fantasy regardless of its form or target audience it 's not quite what you 'd expect from miyazaki considering his recent work but it 's sure to be remembered as another of his beloved stories ~steven c visit my site at http //moviemusereviews.blogspot.com,1

what can i say curse of monkey island is fantastic the story is good and solid but appropriately silly the jokes are hillarious the puzzles are puzzling ... you could n't ask for more in an adventure game the `` you do n't need to see my identification '' bit is in itself well worth buying the game for not to mention murray who has become the hot topic among many of my friends only some of whom have played the game you will love this game and if you do n't too bad,1
i have seen most of john waters films with the exception of several of his very early ones which are not available i have actually seen just about all of them so it 's obvious i am a big fan and it 's certain that i have a high tolerance for the gross and irreverent in his films while way over the top and disgusting i adored female trouble and polyester -- two monumental tributes to bad taste and excess that are seriously funny films so i am certainly not squeamish and can take most of what waters has to offer however in pink flamingos he has created a film so repellent so unfunny and so offensive that i could n't even stand it in his other films he made before he became more mainstream they were funny yet here the humor just is n't there as it seems the intent is to shock the viewers and not entertain them in any way i am glad that after making this film waters sense of humor improved as divine consuming dog feces as in this film is shocking but not the least bit entertaining my advice is to skip this film and just pretend it never happened and then watch his infinitely better films of the 70s and 80s,0
spoilers spoilers here on earth / 2000 1/2 out of four mark piznarski 's `` here on earth '' holds the record for a movie containing the most recycled material in 96 minutes literally every contrivance cliché and familiar plot element are somewhere in here there is simply nothing unique original or fresh about it god what an agonizing motion picture to sit through i wish i saw the film during its theatrical release last year so it could have earned on my year 's worst list this is the kind of movie where the story makes itself instantly obvious and goes downhill from the opening credits and worst of all takes itself seriously `` here on earth '' is clearly one of the most horrible painful movies to come down the pike in some time `` here on earth '' is a teen heartthrob film so it must contain some of hollywood 's most prized young men who are attractive and inexperienced enough to accept a role in a movie as bad as this chris klein and josh hartnett fit that vary description and take the lead roles by storm klein plays kelley an arrogant and insolent student with a wealthy father cliché number one he is to graduate as the valedictorian and attend ivy league college following in the footsteps of his father stuart wilson this sets up the `` i do n't want your life '' cliché in which the father tries to control his son 's life while the son resists rebelliously throw in kelley 's deceased mother who committed suicide a while back when his father brings home another woman he brutally questions his intentions the `` no one can replace mom '' cliché counts as number two josh hartnett plays jasper a character on the opposite side of society to kelley his family owns a local diner enter his long-time love interest samantha cavanaugh leelee sobieski a waitress at the diner who covers for her sister who has no purpose whatsoever rather than controlling the following scene when jasper and kelley act like childish morons by racing their cars and oh no crashing into the diner causing it to erupt into flames conflicts between the rich and poor will count as cliché number three the bungled car chase sets both kelley and jasper up for a contrived and plausible conflict they get in trouble with the law but because this movie feels the need to exist the local judge orders them an alternative to serving time they must work together to help rebuild the diner the two boys work hard during the summer growing strong and getting a nice tan samantha 's eye catches kelley and romantic sparks fly jasper is jealous but wants what is best for his true love cliché number four her parents annette o'toole and bruce greenwood disapprove of her little romantic triangle cliché number five but she continues two timing jasper without a second thought her father also happens to be the local sheriff how surprising lets count that melodramatic nugget cliché number six the contrived romantic feelings between kelley and samantha count as cliché number seven but samantha 's relationship with jasper is never defined so how can there any romantic tension if the film is going to induce involvement in samantha 's choice between the two young men then we need to see both characters from both sides the movie depicts jasper as a distraction to her `` rightful love '' kelley it 's clear jasper truly loves her but it is also clear she does not love him back this absolutely slaughters the romantic tension early in the story leelee sobieski does no harm here however her charm and kind performance do not fit a two-timing character like samantha john hartnett is also right for the role of jasper but the movie gives him nothing to do except bicker with kelley chris klein gets to make a hunk name for himself here he spends much of the movie shirtless sweaty and overworked unfortunately he does not show off his acting ability maybe because he has very little the supporting cast is much more talented bruce greenwood supplies the best performance in the film but does not have near enough screen time to save anything but a few brief moments i also enjoyed the performance by stuart wilson who perfectly fits the role of a rich controlling father of high social status then we lean about samantha 's knee problem exactly one hour and ten minutes into the movie another spoiler ahead what is this she has a serious incurable illness yet another contrivance into the picture approximately number eight her terminal disease brings the two competing young men together as friends well at least i think that is what the movie intended to show that the loss of one loved by two nemeses can bring both together cliché number nine klein rehearses his valedictorian speech to demonstrate his character is more than a shallow stereotype but we have seen this so many times before i would prefer a rich character rather than a deeply sentimental who hides actual feelings cliché number um was it ten the conflicts between kelley and jasper are desperate and inane a `` your mom '' comment triggers a fist fight while they rebuild the establishment there is a retread from `` armageddon '' as samantha and kelley sprawl out

tension an intoxicated kelley makes a fool of himself after getting in a fight with samantha 's date jasper but the following day he recites desires only to dance cliché number oh no i am losing

`` while sporadically engrossing including a few effectively tender moments and humorous the sledgehammer-obvious satire 'homecoming hinges on comes off as forced and ultimately unfulfilling with material like this timing is everything michael moore knew to release `` fahrenheit 9/11 '' before the 2004 elections and the real tragedy of dante 's film is that it did n't come out 2 years ago when its message would have carried an energy that would have energized the dissidents further in 2006 mockery of the well-settled bush administration hardly seems as controversially compelling or imperiled as it did then '' frankly anyone that could be convinced of anything by a ham fisted zombie flick has questionable intelligence and if you did n't notice michael moore did n't exactly help to defeat bush there was nothing engrossing about this film i just felt disgust at how blatant and frankly stupid the film was it was painful to watch if you are going to do something like this you need a bit of wit sadly this has none a poorly done satire actually has the opposite of its intended effect as they say with friends like these who needs enemies,0
so .. what can i tell you about this movie if you cheated a lot in high school you do recognize some cheattips ... this is the best thing i can tell you about this film if you like american-teen movies maybe you also like it but i do n't see this kind of movies as something funny .. sorry to say but if you are older then 10 years i should n't advise you to watch this because there is one shot with a couple of beautiful women girls .. in this movie i 'll give it a rate of 2 so .. deal for yourself good luck,0
this film was not about stereotypes nor dance moves nor pickup lines really this film was about the vulnerability of peoples hearts it was hard to believe that kevin james could play in a convincing role that will smith could satisfy without action and that such a hackneyed genre of film could succeed in such a way i do n't intend to sound overly endeared with this film it was n't `` groundbreaking '' in any sort of way but it was a film worth seeing was it believable no new york could n't be so simple and there has been no human being in the history of mankind that has the `` hutzpah '' of hitch sure there are bar-studs but not ones that can get any chick at any time excluding those raking in seven figures of course the thing that worked best for this film was its true focus on the dramatic side of things not just on the comedy it was a funny two hours no doubt but it was also two hours that made you sit in your seat become immersed in the characters and smile,1
computer savvy john light as john elias goes from stanford drop-out to successful young dotcom-era tycoon but mr. light 's sneering success could be short-lived with partners like ambitious jeffrey donovan as robert jennings mr. donovan used to bed down with light 's girlfriend megan dodds as lisa forrester donovan wants light to know that binge drinking and casual sex do n't have to end in college after reading a naughty internet sex session ms. dodds shines light on he may lose is `` digital dreams '' internet empire too veterans unsuccessfully trying to lending dramatic gravitas include red lollipop-sucking mia farrow as anna simmons and quick-drawing computer-hating hal holbrook as tom walker ms. farrow looks sweet with her lollipops purpose 2/21/02 alan lazar john light jeffrey donovan mia farrow,0
this movie was a waste of time it looks nice pretty settings nicely acted appears earnest and seems to be leading somewhere so you stay tuned awaiting a meaningful payoff it does n't happen it surprised me that so much effort could be put into a movie it was clearly very professionally done and have an outcome that seems nothing short of a b-movie save your precious time and see a good french film like les visiteurs funny jean de florette or manon of the spring i ca n't recall the language in europa europa but that 's another great film -- heavy but very worth viewing this film appears to promise a lot but delivers nothing,0
i first saw this movie in the night program of one of my favourite tv channels .... i was hooked from the very first minute nothing is as it first seems lots of suspense great acting from mr. van dien and i did not mind the `` heat '' in it one bit ... and best of all you are in for a surprise ending,1
one true thing may have seemed like a horror movie to the yuppies of the 80 's but it does n't ring true today ... unless you happen to be part of a pampered upper-middle class family which is so insulated from the world that it has never tasted suffering avoid this shallow flop,0
when i was five years old it was my favorite television show i remembered it was on channel 11 at 2pm everyday the show 's premise was simple with carole and janis as the hostesses of this children 's television show they sang songs and read stories to us as children it was done in a studio with only 54 episodes which was re-broadcasted over and over i remember sherlock the puppet in the tree the show taught us how to count add subtract and the alphabet for thirty minutes a day now i learned something new with paula and janis i remember those days as pleasant memories and now i hope the children of today can learn to love simpler things like hearing stories inexpensive props riding the swings and talking to puppets the set was ideal and simple but it was carole and janis who made it worth while while i miss my childhood and those days where the most important thing was watching the magic garden life seemed so much simpler and better now i hope the kids today enjoy the show,1
forever strong is a type of film we 've seen many time before just in different types of genres however that being said i really thought it was a great film sean faris is showing the type of potential that usually lands actors into big time stardom apparently this film got a limited release as i was n't even aware of it but i saw it in the video store and decided to take a chance with it after i remember enjoying sean 's performance in never back down i ended up making a great decision i 'm not a fan of rugby what so ever but the film really is n't fully about rugby it 's about making a stand in you 're life challenging yourself reaching your goals there is a whole lot more then the simple plot suggests at 1st we do n't give a damn about what happens to rick he 's mouthy full of himself and completely arrogant we feel he 's completely sealed his fate as a trouble maker along the way we see the changes in his character he starts to hang around with better people he starts to better himself we learn how much negative impact his father has had in his life it 's just a great swerve and the film did a great job of turning rick from cocky prick to a good hearted person the rugby action itself is not too bad at all unlike the stuff i played and saw in high school this was actually quite fun to watch and beautifully choreographed a great young cast combined with some veteran experience helped this film immensely it just did a fabulous job of avoiding in what could 've been a run of the mill type of thing to a poignant and effective drama i also liked the conflicting contrast between the coach|garry cole| and rick|sean faris| it made for a very interesting storyline and i loved seeing him help out rick along the way it was emotional and heartwarming at the same time this is a real hidden gem that i 'm truly glad i discovered it made me think about my life and a lot of times i need something like that the performances sean faris is outstanding as rick penning he reminded me an awful lot of a young tom cruise cocky yet very charismatic and talented it was a tough role to turn going from a mouthy teenager to a good hearted young man but sean pulled it off with pure perfection he clearly put his heart and soul into this film so big kudos to sean for putting so much effort into this great film gary cole is excellent as the preachy yet likable coach who wants to help out the kids i 've always found him to be likable he always has a sort of presence he carries to his films neal mcdonough is fantastic as the selfish yet pressured father of rick for the majority of the movie the script leads you to believe he 's nothing more then a selfish bitter man who wants rick to be exactly like him but in the end you start to see the real him come out i felt sorry for him a bit julie warner is a good character actress and she plays the good hearted yet clueless mother well penn badgley is required to play a real jerk and boy does he ever do that well on numerous occasions i wanted to pop him one so i must say it 's a great performance arielle kebbel is the love interest not much of a part she did ok. nathan west plays a somewhat mysterious character he did quite well sean astin is billed as a major player for the film but he barely does anything he did good with what he had to do bottom line-forever strong is a great feel good film it will definitely make you stop and think about how your life was much better then you thought do n't let this one slip you by you wo n't regret it 8 1/2/10,1
johnny knoxville and the boys of jackass go over the top for `` jackass number two '' at a press screening the laughter was so loud and raucous it was hard to hear all the dialog the stunts are over the top and the pranks are funnier and more outrageous than ever before all of the guys put their limbs on the line to make a great film and they succeeded if you like this genre you 'll love this film if not do n't bother some of the funniest bits are the pranks the guys play on themselves and they have no regard for what happens to them they 'll do anything to make a stunt work many critics panned johnny knoxville for a less active role in the first film but not to worry he is front and center in number two and they have enough footage in the can to be half way through a number threee this is a must see for fans of this type of humor chris sansone entertainment editor fort bend herald,1
an absorbing exploration of virtual reality although it is not yet clear how much the director himself intended this film deliberately takes you through several layers of artificial reality leaving only subtle clues about which layer of virtual reality you are in positing an ontological confusion for the viewer to ponder also can be seen as a satire of video games -- the whole movie though may fall into the fallacy of imitative form here it seems unable to escape from the video game genre which it imitates thus the satire becomes problematic a number of interesting ideas crisscross throughout though the biological mutant is one the interface of technology and biology the cyborg urge to transcend reality -- and philosophical allusions such as the title 's to heidegger along with existential questions i.e. the game characters are partly scripted or determined and yet partly free to alter their fate and they wonder at how strange that feels in the game one character then notes that this existential confusion is just like real life thereby erasing again the distinction between the virtual and the real likewise with the observation that it is unpleasant to stumble around in a world where you do n't know what will happen next and you 're not sure how to play since you have to stumble around just to find out the goal and the unknown rules a virtual game within the game is titled `` transcendenz '' also a critique of how virtual violence makes us unable to feel the effects of real violence even the heroes at every level of ontological existence find themselves confused about violence they do n't like it but it is thrilling and part of the `` game '' which then they fear is real the game creator the god of the system is assassinated in the end yet that very scenario is played out in direct parallel to a video game we 've just witnessed -- and the onlookers believe that it is still just part of the virtual reality in the end the film does not resolve the doubt about whether or not this is `` real '' but the point is clear to me anyway existenz means da-sein you are there you are thrown into a set of rules and mysteries at every level ontologically virtual reality recapitulates reality and its common game motifs express like a royal road to the unconscious our own fascination with violence nevertheless while cronenberg affirms these philosophical allusions in an interview about the film he claims that he is very much against the `` reality ... underground name of terrorist group portrayed in the film both in the game and in the 'real level '' seems that cronenberg himself did not put that much thought into the film though his impressive education comes through the interview in cineaste gives the impression of a middle brow intellectual who 's trying to be avant-garde by inclination cronenberg is simply on the side of free imagination -- the clichéd bourgeois modernist credo -- despite the acknowledged ambivalence there my impression here might be due to one limited interview still cronenburg seems to miss the point that his film betrays the fallacy of imitative form here imitating computer games while doing a satirical critique of them but a critique that is unable to `` transcend '' the same form probably because he actually thinks that it is `` imaginative '' and radical yet the film 's imaginative world is less bearable and more jejune than our own all-too-real world it remains trapped in the computer game worldview,1
i 'm sorry perhaps this is part of the wave of praise for fireman since 911 perhaps it 's an old fashioned story perhaps it 's not meant to knock your socks off but i 'm sorry this film is awful as in the title cliché 49 i think it has at least that many clichés it 's a dreary story impressive managing to be dreary when there 's dangerous fires and lives being saved about a fireman and his dreary life told in a pointless 'scene from now flashback to the past style we begin the film with the hero in peril in a collapsing burning building the entire film is about trying to get us to love this guy so we squeeze a few tears out when he meets his end in the finale of the scene from the start of the film i found it hard to care and wished he 'd gone up in smoke earlier clichés abound such as death of best friend love at first site hazing in a new job firstborn a worried wife with a husband with a perilous job a father figure boss/superior 2.4 kids well 2 but close enough sacrificing your life to save others awards for bravery .... on and on it 's every fireman 's life every police officer nurse doctor in some way it was lazy if it was meant as a 'life flashing before his eyes as he died then god help the poor chap i 'm surprised he did n't suck in more smoke to go quicker the flashbacks are mostly mundane and predictable dully acted and with a soundtrack that could put the laughing cow out of business it was so cheesy it actually sounded like muzak or copyright free elevator stuff to be avoided at all costs unless you need something to watch with granny of a sunday evening or maybe if your related to a firefighter warning your life will end horribly or you will be scarred for life if you are a brave fireman according to this movie unless your john travolta strange velcro style hair in this one,0
... if only disney had stayed away from it see i think that this movie has some potential well the main character 's situation does at least take out the whole jordan cahill thing and you 've got the beginnings of a decent movie of course you also lose more than half of the film but oh well not that much of a loss so here it goes you take a typical preppy suburban teenage girl danielle panabaker who 's actually a decent actress whose best friends screech a lot mostly over a `` pop sensation '' i 'm assuming it 's a direct quote from the movie movie 's like this almost always involve that particular phrase named jordan cahill except of course tpstg wants more out of life enter brenda song 's character a sophisticated individual who is just what tpstg needs honestly i do n't care what the character 's real name is i like the acronym better the two new friends go to see jordan cahill one to drool one to make fun of the droolers and they come out of it with his cell phone hijinks ensue and everything turns out alright in the end if only disney or any major film studio for that matter did n't have such a low opinion of 8 to 14 year olds or maybe if 8 to 14 year olds expected a little more out of the movies targeted at them it 's sugar-coated crap like this that make me more than a little unsure who to be more disgusted with a little film called 'high school musical comes to mind ...,0
`` mr. and mrs. smith '' is one of the not too well known early american hitchcock 's movie but if `` lifeboat '' wich unfortunately also belongs to this category is an underrated masterpiece not all the movies signed by the master of suspense in that time the early 40 's are really worth seeing and to tell the truth not discovering this film is n't really a lost `` mr. and mrs. smith '' is an average and conventional screwball comedy where it 's rather hard to find the hitchcock 's touch maybe you can catch a glimpse of his shadow wich is n't much in the cruelty that carole lombard is sometime capable of but it 's well hidden in an impersonal package in a vertigo scene where two of the characters are trapped on top of a trade fair attraction and maybe in the character of the mother and that 's about it even for the hitchcock fan there is little to connect with and for the screwball comedies amateur there is n't very much more none of the situation are exaggerated enough for being really funny and we 're far from the masterpieces of hawks for instance and if one or two scene are quite amusing there 're not even the funniest in hitchcock 's filmography who created comical situations in almost all his movies even `` psycho '' could be considered full of very dark humor so there is really little to save in this movie that can without annoying anyone or maybe only both hardcore fans of hitchcock and screwball comedy who are in love with carole lombard stays one of the not too well known early american hitchcock 's movie,0
anyone who enjoys the lynchian weirdness of twin peaks or any fan of hp lovecraft who knows that the most frightening things are the familiar things will really enjoy this film do n't watch it as a horror film in the `` traditional '' western sense but more like a grimm 's fairy tale it is gory and definitely for 16+ but once you start watching it you too will find yourself drawn into the vortex definitely one of those movies that hangs with you for a few days after watching i 'll never look at my snails the same way again,1
bloody birthday opens to a shot of meadowvale general hospital there three babies are being born at precisely the same time during a total eclipse a caption informs us that it is now 'meadowvale california june 1 1980 two teenage lovers duke benson ben marley and annie smith erica hope are getting down to business in an open grave they hear noises and duke investigates both duke and annie are murdered sheriff jim brody bert kramer is baffled and only has the handle of a child 's skipping rope that annie was holding as a clue unfortunately before sheriff brody can solve the case his youngest daughter debbie elizabeth hoy and two of her friends curtis taylor billy jayne as billy jacoby and steven seton andy freeman murder him just as they are finishing sheriff brody off another young boy from their class named timmy russel k.c martel turns up the three killers are unaware of how much he saw soon after the incident timmy plays with steven and curtis in a junkyard curtis locks timmy into an old locker timmy manages to escape and tell his sister joyce lori lethin but she does n't believe him at first the three children carry on their murder spree their strict teacher miss davis susan strasberg a lovemaking couple john avery and sylvia wright in a van and debbie 's older sister beverly julie brown are among their victims joyce begins to have her suspicions about debbie curtis and steven which makes her and timmy a target for the evil trio will they be able to convince the authorities that these three innocent looking 10 year olds are really soulless killers co-written and directed by ed hunt i have an intense dislike for this film i think it 's absolutely awful and does n't have a single enjoyable aspect to it 's 83 minute running time the script by hunt and barry pearson gives us no explanation for the child killers motives beyond the solar eclipse that blocks out saturn and therefore for some bizarre astrological reason these three children do n't have any conscience so these are the only children ever born during a total eclipse if that is true why do they wait until just before their tenth birthday 's before starting their killing spree i guess it just suddenly kicks in right to it 's credit it is reasonably well paced but i still found it incredibly boring and tedious to sit through the film as a whole is very unexciting and predictable the children are revealed as the killers within the first 10 minutes and as i 've mentioned next to no motive is given it 's very silly at times too check out the scene where debbie stops steven by throwing a bowl of water over him the sheriff 's death is put down to him falling down some steps yeah right the injuries suffered from that type of accident are n't going to be the same as if your beaten to death with a baseball bat like he was in reality any competent doctor or pathologist would have spotted that within 5 seconds there is n't a single drop of blood spilt in the entire film and all of the lame killings are dull and unimaginative there is some out-of-place looking nudity as debbie charges 25c to let boys peek through a hole while her sister beverly strips there is an early scene just after the 5 minute mark when joyce walks from the kitchen to the living room and the boom mike is clearly visible at the top of the screen not even a little bit of it the whole damn thing the general incompetence continues throughout the film the whole production is bland and instantly forgettable the acting is poor throughout those three kids are very annoying and got on my nerves right from the start and made sitting through this film even more of a chore especially curtis in his geeky over-sized glasses i just hate this film really simple as that i ca n't think of a single good thing to say about it definitely one to avoid,0
wow i watched one night at mccool 's yesterday and all i can say is `` wow '' here i go major spoilers would you like a summary of the plot just to see how stupid and pointless this movie is i would never tell anybody to watch it unless i was out to inflict pain upon them anyway here 's a glimpse or a huge chunk of the plot randy works for a bar mccool 's he meets up with this woman named jewel who convinces him to surprisingly have sex with him her ex-boyfriend ends up trying to rob them and gets killed randy and his cousin and the detective at the scene of the crime all fall for jewel she being the mascot of stupidity uses every one of these guys to get what she wants involving a dvd player randy hires a hit man to kill her and eventually the detective is killed by the ex-boyfriend 's psycho brother and the hit man and jewel take off seriously that 's it i left hardly anything out except for a few more sex scenes and a nearly-pornographic scene of liv tyler as jewel using a hose to flaunt her sexuality what was the point of this movie to be honest i think it was so that the producers and directors could show off their male urges which i think is absolutely uncalled for and just plain stupid when i watch a movie i want a plot i want characters i do n't care about sexy woman flaunting anything they might have something should happen in a movie for goodness sake this is as bad as fight club it gets even worse john goodman is the detective devoted to the higher being i myself wondered why goodman would play in something so outrageously pitiful as this but then i remembered that he was in o brother where art thou as well his reputation just went down a notch liv tyler was an amazing actress in the lord of the rings series in this movie she is nothing more than an unintelligent slut who wants nothing but her way her reputation has gone down seven or eight notches to me i am amazed simply amazed that people would work so hard to make something so stupid the music is absolutely crappy having `` ymca '' play while john goodman 's character is being killed does n't really fit the characters are totally unlikeable the plot is one of the most stupid ever conceived by man and to top it off it does n't even fit into any genre the closest it gets to is pornographic comedy if it was even supposed to be funny which it was n't i think i 'm done ranting now but let me just assure you that nobody in their right mind would ever ever want to see this movie unless they lust for liv tyler as much as the characters do that is,0
i happened to catch this on tv and wanted to watch because i remembered the spin magazine article upon which the movie is based i was very disappointed first if james belushi is the lead actor in a movie it should be a sign that it 's not exactly an a-list production gregory hines was a world class dancer but sadly not a great actor in fact all of the acting in this film is either flat or hammy which can only be blamed on the director who is this film 's weakest link charles carner seemed to be trying to ape oliver stone 's `` jfk '' in portraying the alleged conspiracy to cover up the `` real '' child murderer s but without the benefit of a good script an a-list cast or it must be said the talent it just does n't work it 's a shame that such a worthy topic for a film did not get better treatment,0
this was one of the few shows that my wife and i agreed on watching i was upset to hear that it was canceled especially because i did n't realize the ratings were so poor as far as i knew it was doing very well with a lot of viewers almost all my friends and most of the people i spoke to watched the show now we are stuck watching either crappy shows or dvd 's how bad was the show doing does anyone know the real results of the shows viewings i know that when it went to thursdays it was more difficult for me to catch thank g d for dvr 's anyways this was a real surprise to know that there will be no more `` the war at home '' if any other networks see this please pick up the show please,1
seriously i don´t really get why people here are bashing it i mean the idea of a killer snowman wreaking havoc on a tropical island paradise is pretty absurd the good news is the producers realized it and made it a comedy in the vein of army of darkness especially in the second half of the film when the little killer snowballs attack i laughed my ass off for example the put one of the little creeps into a blender a la gremlins 1 and mix it after that it morphs back into a snowball and squeals with a high pitched voice `` that was fun '' bottom line incredible movie rent it,1
well of course the critics hated it this is n't a movie that 's going for the big-time critical acclaim but the fact is that it 's really very good sure if you do n't like that chris farley brand of physical comedy or the exceedingly dry wit of david spade you 're not going to like it but for the rest of us the movie has many hilarious and for that matter quotable sequences and the plot is n't half as dumb as that of `` black sheep '' the parts that are n't meant to be humorous are actually done well not what you 'd expect from a movie of this ilk and the acting is really pretty good `` tommy boy '' is without question chris farley 's best movie i give it an a and suggest you give it a view,1
just before dawn is an excellent horror movie it is atmospheric filled with tension made of wonderful shots of wild nature in which few young people meet their doom in the shape of two crazed fat bastards who slaughter them jeff lieberman is very talented and intelligent director who is unfortunately underrated he achieved to built tension not with gore but with showing menacing nature environment lieberman succeeds to built a tension in a very linear simplistic way which is also the best way not to show to the viewer the gore but to let him to imagine the worst thing that happen to characters just before dawn was always compared to texas chainsaw massacre deliverance and hills have eyes it is as good looking as deliverance better than hills i mean scarier and better crafted and it is creepy as the texas chainsaw massacre jbd is one of the best horrors of past few decades who finally lives on dvd,1
after reading more than my fair share of reviews for a vast number of different movies i have noticed a certain trend people judge to harshly on what the expected to see i figure if you go into a movie open-minded not expecting anything certain than you will have better feelings towards it then if you try and watch but have pre-created standards you want it to reach since i try not to be hypocritical i watched this movie with a very clean slate and open-mind and was very much pleased since it is not a mainstream title or award winning for that matter i did not know quite what to expect but in all truth i enjoyed it a good deal more than ninja scroll lovely animation deep story and the always joyful ninja hack-n-slashing combined extremely well to one of my personal favorite animes ever made i am not promising that you will enjoy it but just give it a chance and you may come out with a pleasant surprise `` before speaking be sure of what you will say will be more beautiful than the silence '' chinese proverb,1
i can name only a few movies that i have seen which were this bad this movie has terrible everything the dialog is corny and cliché the acting is poor for the most part with a few exceptions the cinematography is nothing to cheer about and the plot is silly a fat woman stalks a suburban family because her daughter did n't make the soccer team this is so bad it 's funny to watch if you can catch this on lifetime i 'd recommend it highly as a comedy as for being a serious movie i 'm afraid i 'll have to rate this a 2. do n't watch this film if you are a serious movie fan and looking for an interesting and challenging storyline or good acting there is none to be found edit hmmm ... i think a group of people who work for lifetime must have written some phony reviews and voted all the negative ones down do n't believe them this is a really crappy movie,0
the biggest and most disconcerting things of the raptor movie was ending for the tyransaurus is identical to carnosaur except kid in the loader was a bit better acted and action then the adult the similarities to the carnosaur movies was rather poor choice in plot line the only thing that approached good was the beginning with the kids in the jeep then the plot went down hill from there would have been nice if a different plot had been devised rather then cloning the earlier movies the raptor movie should have taken lesson from jurasic park series in various plots the only movie that has come close to a good dinosaur movie most recently is aztec rex the repeated scenes as if taken from the carnosaur movies leaves a person thinking of those movies,0
this 1931 comedy gets better with every viewing because of the comedic talents of marion davies and a terrific performance by c. aubrey smith smith plays a gruff old man who gathers his grown children from his younger days as a rake in his declining years one is american davies one english ray milland who looks about 18 and one italian nina quartero there are some surprises as the plot moves along with ralph forbes was has no appeal at all falling for davies davies and smith are just wonderful together and very touching davies also gets to do a few dances and make a few `` big '' entrances and of course davies is just gorgeous halliwell hobbes doris lloyd elizabeth murray guinn williams edgar norton and david torrence co-star had they given out supporting oscar awards in 1931 smith might well have been nominated he 's just excellent in this this gem,1
i am not so old that i ca n't remember laughing at bobcat goldthwait a couple times but some where in all his years of drug abuse he lost his sense of humor as well as his brain cells from the moment this film opens you can have no sympathy nor empathy for the female lead neither will you find anything remotely funny after hearing the opening line goldthwait obviously hates himself so much that he needs to degrade in order to feel better- even if it is his own imaginary characters he degrades if you ever saw shakes the clown you know how unfunny bobcat was 15 years ago ... this movie is worse it was not even funny by accident it is sad pathetic and a total waste of time may goldthwaits hands be rendered paralyzed so he can not write another script strike his tongue so he can not dictate another unfunny scene he is sad and pathetic and needs to make room for a new talent dying to get into hollywood,0
i saw le conseguenze dell'amore on the 2005 rotterdam filmfestival it was the first of ten films i saw there le conseguenze has left the most powerful impression of the ten films from the first shot you know the movie is going to be something special the beautiful cinematography left me in awe of what can be done with a camera the music is also on par with the visuals complementing the colorful and stylish architecture-like images toni servillo plays the main character in the film titta he 's a tax expert gone wrong who lives in a hotel every week he brings a suitcase with money to a bank and the story plays around this he is always very controlled and shows almost no emotion to anyone looks calculated and well-dressed he has a habit of ignoring people who are of no significance to him for example sofia played very nicely by olivia magnani who works as a barmaid in the hotel where he lives although she 's been working in the hotel for two years he never greets her even if she does greet him on one day she confronts him with this and the next day he sits at the bar instead of his usual spot at a window from here the story really begins and will unfold in a strong tale of love sacrifice and the mafia i wo n't spoil the rest of the film see this film if you love stylish movies like ones from david lynch the godfather etc do n't see this if you 're an action-buff,1
well to each his own but i thought gibson 's hamlet was the most god-awful rendition i had ever witnessed ... as subtly nuanced as a paper bag and as inspired as a telemarketing call the only reason i watched the movie through to the end was that i held out hope that either it would get better or become unintentionally funny no luck no disrespect for the supporting cast or for zefferelli 's staging but nothing can make up for the bungling of the main character i have seen hamlet well-portrayed as an african prince as an animated lion as a rough-and-tumble warrior as a romantic poet etc etc etc but imho this portrayal was just a plentiful lack of wit together with most weak hams,0
another one that slipped by the radar of most anyone this little b produced gem is so full of new ideas in an old genre and so absolutely refreshing and inventive that a dreadful feeling about the lack of cojones in today 's cinema slowly overtakes your body the final set piece is so innovative in its setting and style that it prefigures everyone from tarantino to john woo oh and if you think `` dying lines '' are all cliche wait for the dying line of ff a piece of dialogue that could have torn you with laughter will take your heart a true pleasure seek it and see it you wo n't be sorry,1
seriously ... i 'm amazed at all the good feedback this show has here all we have in this show is two stupid kids who keep doing an annoying laugh and they do occasional funny things only in like ... 2 of the shows while most of the others sucked ... as then they comment on music videos which i can not stand personally while they either love or like in most episodes the only things you will hear are the repitive `` let 's go score with some chicks '' or `` i 'll kick your ass beavis '' or the better yet and usually used quote `` that was cool '' and above all their annoying laugh if you want a good animated show try the simpsons ren and stimpy south park this show is just not worth the time or energy it takes to watch this awful mtv series truthfully,0
family guy has to be my all time favorite cartoon.it is definitely the funniest tv show ever made and is better than the simpsons.i have never laughed so hard at a tv show in my life the things that make the show so funny is the plot characters and themes that are dealt with in the show.there are very few themes that have not been dealt with on family guy i have seen just about every episode of family guy ever made and would have to say that the show was better in the first two seasons.my favorite characters are peter because he is very funny and is the best character of the show.my second favorite character is stewie because he is the funniest villain to be on a tv show.if you love family guiy you should check out american dad because it is just so similar and is created by seth mcfarlane.i hope this show never ends because it is a comic genius 10/10,1
i am a glutton for b-movies i love the old drive-in fare like this movie this film made for very little money it seems does do one thing that some bigger budgeted films fail it is cheezy it is gory it has no real plot but it entertained me for an hour and a half i was either laughing or covering my eyes in shock there are a few great effects like a shot from inside a guy 's mouth when he gets stabbed in the chin by a knife and it pokes up through his tongue and slams into the roof of his mouth and one gross-out with a guy getting his eyeballs yanked out but there is also loads of zombies and some psycho killers patterned after texas chainsaw massacre and a demon possessed scarecrow i loved the dialogue that the killers spout as they torture and kill people it has great camera work and some cool editing tricks this one is more original than the first bloodbath and the undead look better but it is still patterned after those dubbed trashy zombie movies of the 70 's and 80 's and it still has a cheeze factor that ranks mighty high do n't expect romero just second-rate fulci i would say that horror fans will like it and it is funny and cheezy and a fast ride through b-movie land,1
`` one true thing '' puts zellweger in the midst of a family crisis as an adult journalist who returns home to care for her dying mother streep somber and plodding the film studies the adult child coming to terms with the adult view of her parents as they are slowly revealed to be something less than the ideal she grew up knowing as a child an excellent character study and a find production with little to fault `` ott '' offers three fine performances by a trio of top actors and some plaintive reflections on life and death,1
massive spoilers ahead ok the movie in a nutshell so this girl goes out buys drugs gets pulled over by a cop the cops name is wolf the cop feels her butt then he eats her ... okay he beats her up and eats her then this woman is at home and this guy come with bulging genitals and he does her up then the woman goes into the other room and this black guy is there and she undresses ..... then the movie turns into a porno he starts sucking on her breasts then she gives him head then wolf walks in with blood all over him and says `` honey i 'm home '' then he realizes his wife is blowing some black guy and he kills her the black guy kills him cuts the girl out of wolfs stomach and the go home the end and they lived happily ever after that is the movie now after reading this do u really think there is anything to like about this movie the only thing i liked in the woman had a nice body but the performances sucked the story sucked the dialogue sucked the whole movie just sucked,0
well i expected for all the hype and oscar nominations an epic civil war drama something with the `` magnitude '' of the `` english patient '' given the same director this film is n't of epic stature but it turns out i was relieved it was n't it 's a love story in the midst of the horrors of war where young men are sent off to fight deserters are tracked and killed and the women and children at home are left to fend for themselves while the men are gone anyway i thought nicole kidman and rene zelleweger were pretty decent and not knowing much about jude law he was all right also it seems rene z. had the more fun part of the 3 leads and was able to smartly play a spirited feisty downhome woman with much aplomb also for me it was good to see actress kathy baker ... someone 's who 's talent needs to be more recognized/acknowledged this film is worth seeing this -- i 'm ca n't articulate why really but maybe because it is a slice of americana,1
words can not describe how horrible this movie is well maybe they can i 'll take a stab at it 1 pitiful hollywood makes more talking animals set in graphics apparently script and storyline are n't needed anymore 2 violent kids movie but yet one of the characters is viciously attacked and killed 3 blatantly stupid the movie is actually depicting the farm animals as having human abilities in nemo the fish could talk but for the most part they are still fish we only hear the english as a translation in barnyard the animals are actually speaking english that other people can understand 4 unintelligent no smart story line or even any smart humor ok the 13 year old dog on crutches was funny 5 culturally insensitive the `` black '' cow is actually played by a black actress the pink cow is played by a white actress the black cow was playing a stereotypical black person 6 ignorant no such thing as a male cow that i 'm aware of i believe we call them bulls if we are going to expose our children to drek it might as well have the simplest facts correct 7 boring and borish my 4 year old had us leave after 45 minutes he practically fell asleep i 'm sure this movie will make millions which is unfortunate because it only proves to hollywood producers that the american public at large is just filled with suckers waiting to pay 8 bucks just to get some peace and quiet from the kids for an hour or two an unfortunate circumstance why should the producers spend real money when the returns will be the same either way,0
i thought this movie was awful i understand it was shot on a small budget but the acting was terrible and the movie itself was just plain dumb the plot was predictable and the central character was an unsympathetic moron in fact all of the characters were unsympathetic and none were fully developed at all the audience relates to no one in the movie it was supposed to be suspenseful but if you do n't care about the characters it 's hard to get `` into '' the movie at all i felt like an outsider being forced to listen to someone tell me a stupid story all the plot twists at the end were just a little too much i was actually laughing when i guess i was supposed to be `` shocked '' all in all i thought it was really just a bad movie,0
.... is the boob in the pie every thing else in it is an abortion a malformed failure of a film at least you can see and hear what goes on in an ed wood movie usually high schools drama clubs do better than this on a routine basis once you 've you 've seen the breast pie bit you can turn it off and go watch `` hannibal '',0
whenever an idea was successful during those `` golden days '' of the silent movies you could bet your bottom dollar that it would be repeated although `` reworking '' is the term that is used of course one could make the argument that this reworking business has never left us for success in the movies or tv always leads to a trend with all competing parties vying to come up with their own version of said hit movie or tv program to this last premise we strongly disagree for this is copycatting or plagiarism plain and simple this the last silent laurel hardy short surely must have been quite well received for angora love hal roach/mgm 1929 was reworked on the roach lot not once but twice over the next three years we were treated to laughing gravy roach/mgm 1931 in which the goat was replaced with a cute little puppy-dog also the weather is transformed into the dead of winter in the middle of a blizzard they also made other line-up changes with substituting landlord edgar kennedy with landlord charlie hall the second reworking of the hidden animal premise is the 3 reeler the chimp roach/mgm 1932 which substituted a female ape from a dissolved and defunct circus to which stan and babe were former employees the circus paid off its employees with their assets and the boys received the chimpanzee as their final payday back to our original 'victim today 's subject angora love recomember the short starts off simply enough the boys encounter the goat on the street and the nanny in return follows them back to their rooming house after stan feeds a doughnut to her the comic moments that follow are generated with the interplay between l h and slow-burn exponent edgar kennedy their landlord the incident 's impact is amplified by having the interplay occur at night and as luck would have it their room is situated directly above the landlord 's quarters in addition to the noise the bathing of the goat its odor and landlord edgar 's suspicions about laurel hardy 's having another person illegally in the room we were most amused by a little throw-away gag which may well have been missed by the censors while admonishing the boys about the noise they 'd been making and reminding them of the house rules about any unauthorized person 's being in there overnight regardless of their sex its camera shot is made from inside the boy 's room over their shoulder with edgar in the hall and facing them he warns `` remember this is a respectable establishment '' just as he says this a lady clad in evening clothes walks across and behind the landlord followed by a uniformed sailor who cocks his hat forward as they pass poodle schnitz,1
chan is in new york and he gets involved with an attempt to sabotage a new aircraft design the war was over a year away from reaching america but the second world war was already raging everywhere else in the world and so it colored everything since most people probably realized that war was coming here the war is n't mentioned but the fact that the film deals with the production of planes at the very least alludes to it the mystery itself is pretty good it the notion of plane sabotage lends itself nicely to a couple of rather tense moments to be certain we are talking about charlie chan so we can be certain that he would live to fight another day but there was no guarantee what condition he would be in not whether anyone around him would survive i really like this film a great deal its not one of the nest and far from the worst it is one of the truly rare things a truly enjoyable one definitely worth a look or six,1
yeah sure the movie its visuals already did looked horrible and not very promising but the premise and the cast looked good so i still sort of expected to be entertained by this movie this however unfortunately was n't the case the premise is good but the story is filled with improbabilities and is logically flawed this movie is potential flushed down the toilet the main plot is interesting and somewhat original it 's good enough to make a good adventurous movie out of would you think this movie however fails to entertain and i think that that is this movie biggest flaw perhaps it takes itself too serious and a little bit more humor certainly would n't had done the movie any harm instead it now is nothing more than a lame and cheap looking movie filled with the one unlikely event after the other that also steals a bit too much from other more successful movies mainely `` jurassic park '' obviously the characters also do n't help to make the movie any more compelling or at least interesting to watch i still think that edward burns did a fairly decent job as the 'heroic main lead the rest of the characters however really get muddled in into the movie and they get very little interesting to do the movie rather relies on its visual which are extremely poor catherine mccormack also plays a very irritating character basically all her character does is complain and talk about how right she was and the rest oh so wrong her character just is n't a likable one and the rest of the characters ... well i already have forgotten their names i think that that is saying enough about them it certainly is true though that ben kingsley 's performance alone makes this movie worth watching he is really excellent in his sort of villainous businessman role but from the moment when he disappears out of the movie the movie really goes downhill rapidly visually the movie is extremely poor it has some dreadful looking cgi effects and they could n't even get the more simple 'blue-screen effects look convincing in the movie the sets are also awful and cheap looking like they can fall over and break down every moment the movie never gets tense exciting or adventurous since the story is brought in the least interesting and engaging way possible it 's a very distant movie with distant characters that fails to impress there are plenty of action sequences but all of them are so ridicules looking and far from believable that they never get tense or good enough so basically this movie is lacking in everything that is needed to make a genre movie like this one a good and successful one it 's sad to see how low director peter hyams has sunk to the last couple of years after making some good movies in the '70 's and '80 's 4/10,0
as an adventure mini-series this is about as good as it gets i viewed it when it was originally shown on hbo sigrid is totally believable in her role as philadelphia and the whole production was first rate see all 400 minutes of it if you can i highly recommend this mini-series amazing that i ca n't rate it officially but for you readers/users i will let you know it 's a solid 10,1
will there be please coming an end to hyping movies that are dealing about social conflicts or other human disasters okay `` care '' is about childabuse `` care '' is about perverts misusing boys in a school and how disgusting it might be if it 's a movie with a poor script and made with bad playing actors then it stays a bad movie `` care '' is a movie that could have been but is it because it was a tvmovie i do n't know but everything seemed so limited that it comes over as some cheap movie that will be seen by some housewifes and fathers who decide not to go to bed there are so many unanswered things in this movie ... the relation with his mother for instance or the death of some abused boy from which we know nothing more `` care '' should have been much much better,0
boogie nights is full of surprises nothing quite prepares one for it its soul yes it does have soul whilst tackling the tackiest of subject matter with both a wry smile and respect brillantly cast and wonderful character development the performances somehow combine the best of stage acting with improvisation within a cinema verite style the plot proved richer than i expected and the underlying themes are teased out quite profoundly as each `` b grade '' human being is brought through crisis into perspective a sociologist 's dream case study the film resonates the raw truth of what we all know about self-esteem parental love and lack of it attention/love deficit and its manifestation in adulthood the desperate need to belong something for everyone here .. almost camouflaged as issues of untouchables and their separate milieu but of course they are universal the film works on a number of levels the ironic loop is that the milieu portrayed exists only because of the voyeur who happens to be watching the film ... boogie nights is non judgmental of its subject matter and characters a rarity it deserves every accolade it has achieved and more,1
it would be unwise to judge that that either narrative or documentary to be more authentic than the other both formats have an underlying form of fiction and are never a true reflection of reality as producers seek to reconstruct and narrate stories in their perspectives as both formats usually leaves some issues undiscussed due to 'complexities of subplots and screen time it denies viewers the opportunity to open up debates and to further investigate and construct the real truth adding to the viewer 's inability to evaluate sources eg comparisons with written history and the logics behind arguments history may be open to distortion through narrative and documentary to most people documentary may be seen more truthful as it usually involves actual participants testimonies and real-life footages however these visuals are selected and edited to be arranged in a way that allows producers to present their version of realism to the viewers in the real buddy holly story paul mccartney seeks to establish the buddy holly as remembered by family and friends and how buddy had influence the rest of the music world the testimonies may have been distorted as memories may not be accurate and emotions have evolved to make a legend out of buddy the documentary did make corrections to the film version and cover other events such as there were 3 members of crickets and that buddy 's music was actually heard outside of usa at that time he had to embark on a world tour however it did not go into deep discussion about what happened to buddy 's wife after his death criticism and/or negative discussions may have been left out of the documentary as the producers seek to present a buddy that the world should have remembered eventually we do n't manage to construct the whole truth as we only restrict ourselves to the past 'realties that the documentary tells us personally i prefer a narrative film because it provides rich visual imageries which helps us to reconnect with the collective memory of that era it gives the audiences a more constructive structure of the story and this leads to better memory retention for the audiences when they retell the story there is also an element of flexibility which allows film-makers to express their thoughts and views on certain issues in the buddy holly story racial issues were highlighted and viewers can certainly relate to these issues with respect to current situations movie-goers consistently seek to revisit certain emotions when watching a film and using these emotions audiences can choose to make personal connections with the applied meanings that a film-maker wants to deliver in most stories people are more likely to selectively remember the struggles the inspirations and the way the story ends through the buddy holly story we do remember the struggles buddy and the crickets had how maria had been a source of encouragement and that buddy holly was a great performer until the day he dies,1
no pun intended i 'm not going to spoil anything about the story but it 's safe to assume that you already know what kind of character the main actor portrays and of course being a priest while being `` naughty '' exaggerates all that plus this is the most erotic movie from park chan wook yet if you have seen wook 's previous works/movies you know he is very visual in a good way and it shows again here while it strays away from the vengeance theme of his prior movies on the surface it still has quite some heat hidden underneath and when that boils quite a few bad things start to happen but through all that dark there also moments of light fun to be had too a very stylistic and though provoking movie that lives outside the mainstream and does a very good job ...,1
back in 1995 barry sonnenfeld directed a movie that ended up on many critics best of lists by the time the year 's recaps were being printed in entertainment publications the movie was get shorty and it gave lead star john travolta his second big hit in as many years after pulp fiction put him back in front of the paparazzi 's lenses based on a novel by elmore leonard the film focused on wise guy chili palmer travolta and his attempts to break into the movie business i for one was completely captured by the diverse characters and crisp dialogue of the original so much so that when i heard there was going to be a sequel i seemed to forgo my usual shivering that occurs when a studio tries to rehash what was a good idea over ten years later the sequel also based on a novel by leonard is this time directed by f. gary gray who 's italian job in 2003 was one of the years highest grossing films couple that with the cast now expanding to include uma thurman harvey keitel cedric the entertainer the rock vince vaughn and james woods and you have all the makings of a great continuance in the exploits of one of the more interesting characters of the 1990 's this time round we pick up as chili travolta is leaving the movie business after being disappointed in both himself and the industry for participating in the making of a sequel to his successful first film thanks in small part to his friend tommy athens woods and the misfortune of his death chili decides to look into the lucrative and dangerous music industry this first leads to the famous viper club where chili meets singing sensation linda moon christina milian who as lead of an upstart trio can belt out tunes like whitney houston that is the whitney before bobby brown started bringing home the small packages of sugar linda is under contract with raji vaughn who with his overly apparent gay bodyguard elliot wilhelm the rock plan to ensure linda fulfills the final five years of her contract even if that means putting chili on ice so with linda 's future in the balance chili weaves an interesting web which will include a record producer thurman a gangsta sound mixer cedric the russian mob the police aerosmith 's lead singer steven tyler and a whole lot of angry gun pointing woo-wheee that sounds exciting so why was n't it be cool tries too hard to well be cool but the result is a film that unlike the original has no heart and no soul be cool feels instead like it was directed by a saturday night live producer as there are individual scenes or skits that do n't string together over a whole movie take for example the scene where travolta and thurman dance together for the first time since pulp fiction as black eyed peas performs live in the background the scene is forced and should have ended up on the cutting room floor instead it is coupled between two other needless chapters that do nothing to push the story forwards with any real thrust the aerosmith concert and the rock 's trip to a boot shop are also prime examples of individual moments that do n't amount to much of a movie when put together but those are n't the only issues with the sequel which could probably be renamed product placement with the amount of 2-ways and diet pepsi 's that seem to stare at you more intensely than chili 's serious look the story contains just about every stereotype imaginable and each one has just enough screen time to become slightly offensive or embarrassing whether it is the gangsta entourage or the gay muscle guy that has a movie poster of sylvester stallone 's rhinestone on the wall no characters is above offering us anything we have n't seen many times before and in much better films with the magic all but gone from the first film we end up with an inferior product that is the second film in the past six months ocean 's 13 being the other that cram a bunch of stars onto a marquee only to end up as a movie that no actor would bring to an open audition be cool was a major disappointment i so wanted it to be the get shorty of the new millennium and i ended up with a film where the outtakes must have been a gas but experience left me with a stinker,0
one of the most awaited movie i thought himesh will do a bit of acting but alas all my hope went wrong .. given that the heroine is 15 yrs old omg what did they thought before considering the actress .. may be its because no boby wants to work with hr as he is called in the film human resource as many people wrote in mazagines nevertheless it was a disappointment.i hope the producer does n't make himself bankrupt by making a part 2 of this as this news is roaming around ... the story was predictable one with himesh showing his generosity character throughout the movie which i doubt very well anyways .. the movie is good from those people 's angle who thinks himesh cant do anything wrong 4 out of 10,0
i have not seen a better comedy than the king of queens for many years i rate it one of the best ever i 've just returned to ireland from arizona on american airlines from a biz trip and by chance they showed several episodes i laughed my head off and later i asked the stewards to play again and they did thank you aa the acting from all the team is first rate and especially from kevin james leah remini and gerry stiller but from all of the cast in fact the acting is superb i love all the cast they are so funny there is a hard edge in the king of queens that i love and is seldom seen in today 's tv comedy both leah and kevin play off each other so well that every situation is believable and hilariously funny i have just purchased the 2nd season while i was in az this week and i intend buying the full set the next time i am in the us my son who is 20yrs old also loves this show and its brilliance is that it has the magic to reach out to different generations i would like to thank all those involved with this amazing show it 's so appreciated to see this kind of tv show in what is in my opinion an era of poor tv fair in general these days with the exception of re-runs of seinfeld and such like ... thanks for a great show ..,1
maybe if you smoked enough weed this would seem funny or would make you nostalgic for how completely unhinged people allowed themselves to be in the early 70 's there 's an odd innocence to this movie and the sex is a lot more awkward and playful than the steely pros who do it for the cameras now the real curio here and really the only reason to watch this movie is the appearance of kristine debell as alice she was a ford model and it shows she 's got classic wasp-ish good looks like a really cute ivy league sorority girl so what the hell is she doing in this cheap cheesy skin flick from my vantage point she does not appear to be at all on drugs in this movie which might explain it and she actually seems incredibly committed to the part when she sings her first song she really does act like she thinks she 's flippin julie andrews or something i just get the feeling that this girl truly believed this was gon na be her big break or something instead of the near career killer that it was anyway she is damn cute and you kind of ca n't believe she would even get naked on screen much less do a masturbation scene a couple of oral sex scenes with men and women and then do the real deal as a climax to the film snark it is also definitely not a body double at all that is our little kristine taking one for the team or for the greater glory of showbiz or something it 's pretty amazing to watch and it is definitely stimulating ahem but in a way i kinda wish she had n't done it that was a very pretty talented young girl getting some really bad advice anyway my guess is that kristine debell wherever she is has long long since wished this movie would go away she was very cute and appealing in `` meatballs '' almost impossible to believe this is the same girl but it is,0
that welles said was that he 's been in decline his whole career there was an interesting story here unfortunately welles seemed completely incapable of telling it instead he was trying to tell a bunch of different stories about elmyr about clifford irving about his pompous view of critics and experts oh yeah and trying to jump start his current girlfriend 's career by giving her unneeded screen time oja honey when they told you to sleep with the director they did n't mean one washed up like a whale on a beach welles was probably trying to cash in with a bunch of footage of clifford irving as irving was becoming a household name with his role in the faked auto-biography of howard hughes unfortunately it means the subject of his film elmyr did n't get the time he deserved and he was probably the more interesting story the great tragedy of orson welles was that he peaked early and then spent the rest of his career sputtering finally doing wine commercials and awful documentaries ...,0
let 's get this out of the way so the ones checking out this page looking for info on anything related to the word `` breasts '' and you know who you are googlers can move along this is not in any way pornographic on the contrary if this has any value as masturbation material then frankly the filmmaker did n't do a good job since the aim is to keep it on subject and on the experiences of women and their bodies and images of themselves and society and health and so on indeed i would be a little circumspect of one who came across this on dvd or if it ever plays again late night on hbo or cinemax and used it as a means for pleasure you might as well go to the supermarket and pick up a pair of ripe melons and take them home and squeeze them and uh well you get the idea no this is semi-serious film-making meant for premium late-night viewing but it should n't have to be just for the late-night types this is intimate in setting but not in tone all of the women in all their variety of shapes and sizes and races and even with one man thrown in with fake breasts have something of value to say from life experience in the most straightforward way if i say semi-serious it 's due to the several little segments that the director feels she needs to throw in with the archival footage of old `` how-to '' videos about puberty and sex and breasts and super-rare cartoons with the knockers flying about this is n't a problem but an asset we need a few little visual seg-ways to go between these interviews nothing is held back and we see it as feminism in a liberating form they do n't need to cover up and even if they choose not to take their tops and shirts and bras off they 're still open as can be about a natural part of their body that is an object of sex surprise comfort discomfort curiosity motherhood and sadly cancer in that last part there 's another brave step taken as we see a woman who survived her cancer with only one breast you know you 've become mature and an adult when you can see this woman who has somehow gone on to live a semi-normal life with one breast the most bittersweet moment is when she says if a fairy godmother said she could have one wish to have two full breasts she would have to think about it and you do n't snicker or go `` eww gross '' that 's the test folks it 's not shot under the best of circumstances but then again for tv it 's edited with a tight pace it 's never dull for a moment and we never feel like anyone is holding back especially when a man might hear the hard truth like that breasts may not really be erogenous or that a flat chest is very attractive to some men breasts a documentary is about deconstructing myths with real faces and breasts and minds and hearts laid bare if that 's worthy of a `` i was alone '' session then well more power to you i guess though it 's not the intention,1
unlike most people who 've commented i was born after the last sylvester mccoy episode and so could n't have compared the two centuries of doctor who at first i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series i have since then seen old episodes of doctor who and some where great but like the doctor the series needed to regenerate to continue the 21st century doctor who 's are great i thought martha was great almost a match for the doctor and if jack 's appearance is anything to go by she 's going to be brilliant when she cameos in series 4 or 5. speaking of jack the spin of torchwood is also brilliant and you should watch both of these programmes though this is definitely more suitable for kids however if you insist that this is n't the same and just is n't doctor who please just stay in your basement 10/10,1
corny and horrible i was not surprised this short lived show did n't make it i remember fondly when tales from the crypt tried reusing these corny episodes like they were actually scary coupled with bad acting and lousy music i was surprised this crummy showed was ever conceived it never showed up again and one can only be thankful for this circumstance,0
`` uzumaki '' takes place in a small japanese rural town where people are going mad.they go nuts over vortexes and spirals.the crisis is getting worse because people are turning into snails and vortexes appear everywhere `` uzumaki '' has to be one of the most bizarre and original horror movies i have seen.the plot is really clever and the gore scenes are really funny as the film does n't takes itself too seriously `` uzumaki '' is wonderfully photographed and the use of colors is top-notch.the characters are likeable and there is enough shocking surprises to satisfy fans of japanese horror.despite of some hilarious scenes the overall tone of this film is pretty dark `` uzumaki '' is not as good as `` ringu '' '' ju-on '' or `` audition '' but if you like japanese horror movies you wo n't be disappointed.7 out of 10,1
all those who are into the pc culture are aghast at the dogmatic christian view of this film claiming it contains racist ideation and/or religious intolerance those who do n't care about this but are oriented towards slick production values and competent acting are dismayed at the lack of such here those who decry both of these are apoplectic that this production was let loose on the general public as evidenced in comments here what is an interesting premise which is n't original but is a combination of ghost and from beyond is dealt with in a rather immature manner in this film yet done with gusto what the crew and actors lacked in sensibility professional abilities and technical expertise is somewhat offset by the intensity they display it is n't nearly as bad as many here think and would have been fine in the hands of someone with maturity and common sense and it is enough below mediocrity to elicit laughs and groans however it unfolds with enough intensity to keep interest throughout and is close to on par with a corman-produced entry of his earliest period of work or the material of arkoff or sam katzman if you get it for 2 or less as did i you wo n't feel disappointed but will wish you could have had a say in how it was made,0
i have rated this movie a 1/10 and have done this in good nature this movie is not as it seems and i don t get the point of it take the first joke for instance their 's that sign at the beginning to start well that was ok but then they start having some guy talking about the hood and then he dies then theirs the other guys who talks then he dies after the other guy says people don t get to their birthday with out dieing and he gets a cake now then he dies the jokes are just stupid they are t that smart and i would have thought they would have been better from some one like the directors of scary movie shawn wayans written by marlon wayans written by phil beauman written by but it sucked and i hop next time they want to make another comedy they make some good jokes not lame ones,0
this one 's as cheesy as they come  the concept of a massive and indestructible extraterrestrial bird is already too loopy for words but wait till you get a load of the goofy creature as it appears on screen i tell you i laughed so hard through this thing that i missed out on some of the expository dialogue  then again the latter is often so heavy on scientific jargon and laws of physics and such at which i 've never been any good in spite of my love of sci-fi movies that it did n't really matter anyway the bird  first depicted as a mere blurred form whizzing through the skies but subsequently shown in all its dopey glory  is so sublimely silly that it would n't be amiss in a looney tunes cartoon witness the series of intermittently-taken photographs that start with the creature in the distance and end on a side-splitting extreme close-up of its face director sears had fared much better with his other film about ufos the fine earth vs. the flying saucers 1956  with special effects provided by a master ray harryhausen speaking of which i 've just given away my copy of the latter in anticipation of acquiring columbia 's recently-released se dvd also it seems to me that some of the footage illustrating the bird 's rampage in new york here were lifted from the destruction of washington seen in that earlier sci-fi classic again the leads are played by genre regulars  namely jeff morrow from this island earth 1955 and mara corday from tarantula 1955 as with the afore-mentioned flying saucers these titles are highly-regarded and beloved by fans  consequently they are vastly superior to this lamentable addition to the alien/monster animal cycle prevalent during the sci-fi heyday and beyond incidentally other flying menaces were featured in the flying serpent 1946 which i have n't watched and larry cohen 's tongue-in-cheek updating of same in q the winged serpent 1982 unfortunately the giant claw ca n't even rise to a decent climax  which is so rushed as to be `` a wash-out '' to quote a jet pilot from the film itself whose assault with rockets on the bird proves completely ineffective that is before morrow realizes that it 's shielded by an invisible barrier and then has to figure out a way how to be able to penetrate it ultimately apart from the intractable and frankly tedious technical asides one gets a feeling of `` so bad it 's good '' watching this after all it only lasts for 74 minutes  and in any case the bird is such an unforgettably daft creation as to put a huge smile on your face every time it turns up,0
had the pleasure to see this film at the big bear film festival where it won the audience award and i have to say it was well deserved because boy next door is a very funny short film the script is well written and keeps things escalating it also has a great current of suspense coursing through it you do n't know what 's going to happen next as the main character tries to deal with the realization that his new neighbor might not be the most ideal person to be living across from him the jokes are quick and unexpected the plot keeps us guessing the dialog feels very real i thought the direction was first-rate and the director travis davis shows a lot of potential for making it big in the world of studio comedies not small praise considering he also is the lead actor of the film so he had to do triple duty on this writing directing and starring if you get a chance to see this film on itunes it 's worth the download it 'll make you laugh out loud a few times and that 's more than most shorts offer these days,1
to say i was disappointed is an understatement an amateur film made by professionals i was about to leave the theater in two or three occasions something i 've never done i was stopped by cloris leachman really she rings true the only one i should say this new women are less modern than the george cukor women of the 30 's this ones are `` acting '' for us trying to be with it but their `` conflict '' is exactly the same as it has always been in movies anyway the fun of the original was based on a crisp vitriolic and very funny script a masterful direction and an unrepeatable cast all the elements that are missing here tv actresses mingling with models and oscar nominees/winners there was n't anything organic about it the whole thing felt like a put on improvised in the moment without a clear objective 2/10,0
pretty pictures with a cool sound track do not constitute a 'movie like all pop promos mdh 's pretentions are are outdone only by its unjustifiable budget one dollar spent on this aimless purposeless dross was one dollar too many stick to penning pop songs bono,0
ladies and gentlemen allow us to introduce to you the toltecs this ancient latin american tribe even preceding the aztecs supposedly had the most malevolent and bloodthirsty sorcerers yet they get their asses whooped by a couple of college floozies and a one-hundred-and-seven-year old lawman with a whip but before you get to see this however you have to struggle through more than 40 minutes of sheer boredom infantile pranks and sleazy sequences that do n't contain any actual sleaze in case i have n't made myself entirely clear yet `` the dark power '' is an indescribably cheesy and inept piece of 80 's horror crap that still manages to be amusing because of its sheer and somewhat charming stupidity factor writer/director phil smoot 's intentions were obviously admirable but he  as well as the rest of the cast crew  lacked the talent and financial means to deliver something even half-decent smoot carefully watched `` the evil dead '' and other similar demonic-themed movies and somehow must have thought he could pull this off as well the movie opens with an old indian guy dying in his isolated countryside house barely speaking out his last word above a whisper toltecs his grandson promptly rents out house to a bunch of college chicks including a typically 80 's aerobics babe a cute black girl and a racist redneck gal soon they will discover why exactly the old indian lived like a hermit as he was actually the guardian of an ancient toltec burial ground toltec sorcerers buried themselves alive only to emerge again thousands of years later and feed on the flesh of the living and honestly is there any better tasting flesh than that of bimbos as hinted at before already the first half of `` the dark power '' is terribly lame and sleep-inducing the clichéd pranks the retarded dialogs and the ridiculously overlong footage of lash larue swinging around his whip seem to go on forever then the movie loses its last smidgen of credibility when the toltec sorcerers emerge from the ground instead of menacing they look like drugged out hard rock stars with imbecile masks and drunken gestures exactly one gory moment is worth mentioning when a guy 's lips are stretched out over his entire skull but overall even the carnage aspect of this movie is disappointing the only remotely worthwhile moments are utterly senseless like when a 9-year-old kid named cletus goes joyriding with his uncle 's truck or when the vulgar naked chick sips beer in the bathtub after working out seriously unless you get turned on by the sight of a 1940 's western veteran swinging around his whip at nothing i 'd advise to skip this film,0
let me start of by saying that i never wanted to see this movie in the first place i had to watch it one day and i figured that i guess i can lighten up and enjoy it for what it is and it might turn out to be entertaining what i got going in with that expectation was one of the worst movies i have ever seen bar none first of all there was nothing humorous in the least bit the creators expected humor to be laughable/passable if they include sarcasm in every line that comes out of underdog 's mouth and use scene after scene of bland played out aspects to `` charm '' the audiences light-hearted side while still making them `` ooh '' and `` ah '' for more with boring action scenes and insipid lackluster performances that made me want to yell at everyone in the audience that was enjoying it the acting was dull the humor was tedious and the characters/plot felt like they spent about 10 minutes creating their entire personalities which gave the uninspiring actors/actresses no range on how to portray their characters with the least bit of depth this movie is plain and simply awful in every field and really only kids under the age of 10 will be able to enjoy it which even though that 's what age range it was aimed at that does not excuse it for being so poorly daft and causing me to feel so penitent parents spend your money on up wall-e the spiderwick chronicles the water horse or hotel for dogs for the best recent family/kids flicks or even alvin and the chipmunks is better than this filth,0
this movie was awful it centered too much around eddie clark griswald 's brother-in-law eddie works much better when changing good quips such as in `` christmas vacation '' and `` vacation '' i really do n't understand how a movie like this would be given the thumbs up now do n't get me wrong i like randy quaid but just felt this movie was totally wrong for him and for the character in general this movie leaves much to be desired and really needed some bigger name actors,0
i think cheaters needs to be off the air and end the reality show once and for all i do n't care what anyone says you can attack me or agree with me but its times like this that the show is just spewing out propaganda and the host of cheaters joey greco is a little bastard who wants to think that showing people on camera is effective and unawares no it just will show disgusting he is also the wiretapping and following of people by `` cheaters spy 's '' is illegal and a federal offense we are living in a police state like the soviet union and nazi germany rolled into one i am happy that there is poor reviews on this trash this needs to end soon or we are going to lose our liberties as a nation no wonder our country is going to hell its because of this and other filth shows i liked the older shows better from the 1950s-1980s i hope you all agree with me on that thank you infowarrior,0
i always enjoy watching this cartoon with sylvester trying to catch tweety on a train rather than at grandma 's house it 's actually a standard fare but entertaining especially when tweety pulls the emergency stop cord one of my complaints about this is how sloppy the animators were with the train when you watch this over and over like my little boy did who loves trains which is why he liked it so much you begin to notice some things throughout this short the position of the baggage car changes on the train either 3rd 4th or 5th and in long shots not at all the engine has either the number 651 or 814 or none at all the coal tender has either the number 99 or the letters `` s.p q.r '' on it or no number or letters at all the coaches carry the `` s.p.q.r '' without the `` '' in long shots and then in closeups it has the words `` southeast and western '' all of this does n't interfere with the story but the production details were obviously not looked into very carefully still this cartoon is among my favorites with sylvester and tweety,1
i found this movie to be a simple yet wonderful comedy this movie is purely entertaining i can watch it time and time again and still enjoy the dialog and chemistry between the characters i truly hope for a dvd release,1
i hated it i hate self-aware pretentious inanity that masquerades as art this film is either stupidly inane or inanely stupid after the first half hour i fastfowarded through the dvd version and saw the same juvenile shennanigans over and over and over i became angered that i had spent hard-earned money for sophomoric clap-trap tinting drivel in sepia or blue does not make something a movie let alone art,0
thank goodness for the coen brothers their success has brought them bigger budgets but has n't rid them of their creativity i had planned on seeing another movie but it was sold out so i went to this one instead by the time it began i had forgotten what movie i was there to see i was surprised in more ways than one this movie is hilarious but they do n't make any cheap jokes just to get the laughs the writing is brilliant and delivered with great skill by george clooney after this nobody can say he 's just a pretty face and the rest of the cast it can be appreciated on many levels whether you remember the odyssey or not i ca n't remember the last time i saw a movie that was this clever i 've seen others i would describe as beautiful intriguing funny and charming all of which also describe `` oh brother '' but this movie reminded me of older seinfeld episodes where all the subplots came together in the end you can feel that their journey is building up to something but you ca n't tell what and the coen brothers do not fail us the end is certainly not disappointing it 's surprising and ties up all the loose ends neatly without wearing the story out,1
the killing yard is a great film although uneven at times morris chestnut puts forth a phenomenal effort as a mentally wounded and judicially jilted prison inmate and the presence of alan alda as his defense attorney is none other than genius the emotion and raw reality portrayed in this film 's `` flashback '' scenes have the ability of putting viewers directly into the midst of the events being pictured i was not even born when the attica riot took place however through extensive research i find that `` the killing yard '' does the story all of it 's fair justices i would definitely recommend this film for viewing by any educational or activist group as a much needed learning tool,1
while star trek the motion picture was mostly boring star trek the final frontier is plain bad in this terrible sequel the crew is on shore leave when they get a distress signal from the federation that ambassadors representing earth romulus and kronos the klingon home world have been kidnapped by a renegade vulcan bent on his quest to attain a starship to venture into the great barrier there he hopes to find god using mysticism and bad writing he persuades many of the senior officers of the enterprise to betray kirk and get a hold of the ship they do reach the inside of the great barrier and find a planet where they do meet a god-like alien this one is so bad it is hard to figure out where to begin at the core is a good idea that is never really developed the plot goes nowhere instead of where no man has gone before it is almost like the writers had no idea how to end this fiasco the action scenes do n't have the suspense of wrath of kahn the philosophy is boring and the humor is stale now i will focus most of my anger on william shatner when he takes the director 's chair the ego gets bigger most of the focus is on him spock and mccoy but does not give the others enough to do moreover whereas shatner is usually guilty of over-acting in previous movies and television spots he is just plain bad in this one now kirk is reckless a practical jokers and silly one of the worst scenes involves the three leaders singing the song `` row row row your boat '' in a round by a campfire in any case this is the worst of the star trek franchise i should have given it three out of ten instead of five,0
i have to admit that i liked this film much more than i expected to will smith has that clean-cut charm that you just ca n't help but like the plot was a minor twist on basic romantic comedy stuff somewhat reminiscent of jane austen 's `` emma '' this guy kevin james has a real flair for comic timing and physical comedy i have never seen his tv show but he was cast very well in this film amber valletta was good enough i ca n't remember why she was a rich celebrity in this film but if she was supposed to be an actress or model then the casting might have left something to be desired i enjoyed julie ann emery and wish she 'd had a larger part but saving the best for last eva mendes more or less stole the show her beauty and charm and just the right amount of standoffishness had me glued to the screen whenever she was there i hope to see more of her in the future this film is definitely worth checking out,1
first and foremost i take issue to the title of this movie 'chupacabra is not a spanish word the name to which they are referring is 'chupacabras i imagine they dropped the 's because it sounds plural that way but i assure you it is singular in spanish next i thought this movie had been done years ago it came off as one of those b horror flicks i watched when i was an early teenager at home when my stepdad was out of town then it would have been kind of scary let 's talk about the special effects the most important 'effect is the costume used for the chupacabras given that it is the main character you would think some serious money would have been put into it but that is n't so the shape color and texture were all goofy like some stupid haunted house at disney world there were times when the chupacabras was walking where no man could walk his movement were jerky and strange at these times but moving around on the floor looked like any normal man another thing i take issue to is that there is no animal in the world that goes around slaughtering everything it sees with no regard to actually eating it the chupacrabas would kill one then the next but it never seemed to actually eat the victim you say `` it 's just a movie '' and i agree but the idea is so far out there that it 's stupid what country is dr. pena from he sounds sort of jamaincan/hawaiian/british/something-else but i think he 's supposed to be latino the problem is his accent is so bad that even a russian could tell he was n't latino the soldiers fired round after round at this thing and were n't making a dent yet the continued to fire i 'm no military man but do n't soldiers especially the special tactical forces such as this have to have some wit about them to perform their duties would n't they figure out that it was a waste of time to shoot and try something new they did n't they just kept firing away while the chupacabras continued to slaughter and not eat them did they have to kill the little dog anyway my vote was 3 for this flick because it was bad why did i watch the whole thing i 'm sure you 've done the same on occasion so do n't give me an flack,0
this movie was a complete disaster for me there is one thing that movies must have in order to be watchable and that is some psychological credibility of characters ... unfortunately here this is not the case the main characters behave irrationally most of the time and even if they have some reason for such behavior it is not revealed to us by the director sophie marceau 's character is particularly irritating making pictures of everything throughout the whole movie when one could expect something more rational for example meeting with her mother in the hospital ... and why exactly did she marry this guy no this is not a spoiler the plot at times seems like ripped off some soap-opera and while the actors performance is not bad this does not help much all in all i just could not find a way to connect with this movie not that i tried too much after the first hour though i have never walked out of cinema during a movie but this time was the closest in my life so far,0
it s funny how instinct warns you of something for example as soon as the company credits read nu image i knew instinctively i d seen a really crap film by them somewhere before but couldn t remember where nevertheless i just knew judge and jury was going to be crap and it was maybe i m psychic mild spoilers the opening is rather violent with several people getting blown away for no more reason than being in the wrong place at the wrong time i don t know about you but i m geting slightly fed up with exploitive violence onscreen nowadays along with bad language especially if it s spouted by actors as bad as the ones in this movie anyway the plot revolves around the bad dude getting executed and coming back to reek revenge on the man who shot his wife oh did i mention the bad dude and his wife murdered a couple of people on their wedding night yeah he s a serious badass mofo in fact he s so bad and i don t mean the acting i ll get to that in a moment that he s impossible to take seriously and this is before he s executed only to return as elton john elvis a french chef etc i wonder if keith david got paid for this because he looks lke he s having so much fun on screen that s the only reason he s playing the role what a pity this reviewer didn t have any fun whatsoever watching judge and jury hey maybe the producers could send me keith s fee gawd only knows i deserve it i disliked this movie a lot as if you hadn t guessed and my main beef isn t with the stupid plot or the cheap production values but with its attitude to violence if like me you ve had a wine bottle cracked over your head or been kicked in the ribs very hard several times you ll know violence is an obscene painful thing but judge and jury will have you believe that if you re thrown through a window crash through some bannisters and fall twenty odd feet onto a table not only will you be unhurt but you ll be able to outrun a couple of rabid devil dogs it could of course be argued that any film starring sly arnie or bruce also suffers from this same dishonest showing of violence but with judge and jury it yanked my chain,0
i reveal two 'twists at the end of the film do not read if you want to watch this movie for some reason oh my this is bad and for some reason sean bean one of the greatest present day actors has sold his soul and appears in it the only consolation is that the scriptwriters must have realised that someone as ultimately pathetic as steve guttenberg could never in his life aspire to kill someone as cool as sean bean instead he is killed in what must have seemed like a marvellous twist at the end by the good guy who was meant to be be killed by bean but was actually his boss and faked his own death do n't worry i have n't ruined anything for you the acting itself is spectacularly apalling with guttenberg 's patented `` hey-look-i-can-pull-a-chuck-norris-face '' hard man stare dominating most of the two hours of hell on earth added to a plot that i could have written whilst being tortured and hung upside down with both hands cut off there is also a completely nonsensical critical error in the fact that one moment the virus will escape if they so much as look at it wrong while another moment steve guttenberg is bravely running around with it throwing catching bashing and generally abusing this 'virus which has the distinct look of a collection of those little balls of soap you put in your bath my final word if you are suicidally depressed and feel like you want to laugh manically at something that should be a bad comedy but even worse is n't tape it next time it 's on channel 5 at midnight then burn it when you realise that i am indeed telling the truth,0
if family guy offends you or you simply do n't get the humor unfortunately this show is making fun of you and the masses of overly religious dull and politically correct people in america so put your morals aside and have fun with this show fg is a hilarious mind opener on the reality of today 's society whoever said this show is for a young immature audience is very mistaken with all the references to old movies and politics 10-80 years ago i could n't imagine any young immature kid finding this funny family guy is definitely for a mature open-minded audience who are not afraid to criticize american society hats off to seth and the whole crew who were able to make this show happen,1
tv newscaster kimberly wells jane fonda and her radical camerman richard adams michael douglas are at a nuclear power plant when a serious accident happens the plants managers play it down but adams has filmed it all wells and adams try to get it on the air but the corporation that runs the plant prevents it plant executive jack godell jack lemmon realizes there are serious problems and tests have been falsified he tries to get executives to believe him -- only they know it wells adams and godell find all their lives are in danger i saw this in a movie theatre in 1979. i was only 17 and it scared me silly to make matters worse the three mile island accident happened around this time making the movie all that more real seeing it over 20 years later it does n't scare me but it still is an excellent film -- it works as a mystery a gripping drama and an expose on the nuclear power industry fonda with red hair has one of her best roles as wells -- she perfectly conveys her character 's growing suspicion and horror when she realizes a nuclear disaster could happen lemmon is as always excellent he starts out believing in his company and the job and slowly starts to unravel when he starts finding things out he was rightfully nominated for an academy award for this douglas is good but he has a small part and is completely overshadowed by lemmon and fonda a really great film -- one of the best of the 70s do n't miss this one,1
contains 1 spoiler market with not presenting itself as yet another remake of `` the interview '' five fingers actually is alas besides maybe the hardship of physical torture it never adds anything to it 's predecessor 's accomplishment in terms of suspense plot or performances in fact five fingers never gets anywhere near its level what i found to be in particular painful to watch was n't the torture itself but the way martijn ryan philippe acted out his ordeal to me it looked as if philippe tried too hard to get his accent right and it made his performance glibly amateur which in turn even dragged down the performance of an otherwise great colm meaney phillipe 's accent btw being far from anything near dutch sounded more like eastern european besides the acting of philippi which to my surprise turned from poor to actually decent towards the end there is the matter of the flashbacks with the hackneyed dutch scenery if these scenes were set in switzerland they would have had the cast eat cheese on mountaintops with endless pastures with grazing cows wearing expensive timepieces scenery aside the way these flashbacks pushed the plot did n't work for me at all it made it being served like french fries at a drive-in and caused the build-up of suspense to flatline admittedly the movie did become more enjoyable as phillipe 's acting improved but i could n't help being annoyed every now and then with scenes that were just too implausible e.g start spoiler at some point after days philippe is almost tenderly washed by the female terrorist this only to be followed by the brute severing of yet another finger why give the guy a wash if he 's in for a torture and the severing of that last finger seemed to only serve the title of this flick anyway i mean he was practically begging to have it knifed off did n't make sense end spoiler what ultimately kept me watching was the performance of fishburn who once again proved to be a brilliant actor but who also had the best part of the script to work with all in all one is just far better off seeing `` the interview '' with that other matrix-icon hugo weaving and when you do i 'm confident you wo n't find this review that disagreeable 3.5/10 `` the interview '' 1998 www.imdb.com/title/tt0120714/,0
this movie was incredibly stupid with meaning what so ever i fell bad for all the actors and actresses that ruined there career to be in this stupid movie the entire movie was based on how unrealistic they could make it to make little like it which made it even stupider even some of the names were unrealistic the film is fun to watch which is why it had 2 out of 10 stars this is probably the 3rd stupidest movie ever made i got really made after i realized that it had mostly adult actors in it yet in was a kid movie the most upsetting one was danny trejo a horror movie actor who is always dirty the other actors were pretty much clean as far as i 'm concerned,0
a coming-of-age story about a teenager rebelling against the church and her minister father in a small norwegian village the countryside setting is picturesque but the story is rather pretentious and plodding with much of the film devoted to quoting scriptures it 's like watching a religious propaganda movie theisen who has made only one other movie is pretty good as the sensitive young protagonist as are sundquist as her strict father and riise as a woman that theisen is fascinated with the film aims to be fresh and charming but feels rather stale and tired director and co-writer nesheim who has worked mostly in tv is not up to the task,0
there 's something wonderful about a `` revenge '' film everyone wakes up in the morning believing he/she is the star of `` the movie '' and that anyone who interferes with one 's own personal agenda is in some way the enemy revenge plot films work particularly well if a person has low self-esteem rather than fighting back in the moment the `` hero '' draws upon built-up inner anxiety to engage in a single act of power in an attempt to restore equilibrium quite naturally in the `` real world '' this type of revenge seldom relieves the tension because life is not a movie after the revenge is enacted the actions taken have their own consequences a good revenge flick helps people ignore this bitter pill in the movies the end credits roll and all responsibility resolved `` swimming with sharks '' is advertised as a comedy no doubt an act on the part of the producers to figure out just how to sell this oddity it 's dark but it is n't dark comedy `` company of men '' and the works of todd solondz come much closer parts of the film are so brutal they pre-date the current `` torture-porn '' genre everyone is so obsessed with `` saw '' `` hostel '' there are some laughs there are laughs in `` saving private ryan '' too but it is n't labeled comedy the intrinsic problem with this film is that it has n't earned its revenge case it is ostensibly about a young man who is abused by his boss and eventually takes his boss hostage to `` pay him back '' for all the mistreatment the hero aptly named `` guy '' is an `` everyman '' so vague we know literally nothing about him ... what does he do with his spare time does he have friends/family how did he get where he is what are his interests this becomes a running motif through the film no doubt inspired by the film 's author 's own struggle ... '' what do you want `` the answer to which we are denied by a vague cheat of an ending it 's very difficult to care for such a character even if acted well even tom hanks becomes a creep in the wrong roll such as `` punchline '' kevin spacey as the boss `` buddy '' is supposed to be a monster but he 's too charismatic as an actor the best laughs came when he abused his assistant -- he seemed almost as surprised as the audience probably is at what guy will endure when kevin 's character is being tortured the view taken suddenly becomes empathy for him guy is suddenly filmed as a leering monster without rationality at this point any message the author had has been lost there 's no `` hero '' in this film ergo no reason to care at all it 's not a stretch to assume this story is based on the author 's own troubled career in the film business i worked for a similar boss and can vouch that it 's not that far-fetched i had similar wish-fulfillment fantasies at that time and thought that i was justified i thought you could win over the most beautiful woman in the story actually the only woman -- there seem to be all of about four people in the universe of this film just by being your eager naive self that eagerness won accolades and that a boss abused you because he was a mean person time and tide have revealed the truth that most `` monsters '' are really just the demons of an individual 's personal psyche and resentment is usually based in the self as the film points out if guy was so unhappy he only had to leave the film does n't offer any denouement at all `` surprise '' ending notwithstanding we still know nothing about the protagonists we ca n't even be sure anything they said was based in fact and everyone magically gets to have his cake and eat it too in short there was no point to this story at all other than to point out that shock the film business can be pretty brutal there are plenty of good films that tell solid and satisfying revenge-style fantasies both the feel-good variety `` 9-to5 '' `` working girl '' `` the devil wears prada '' and not so much `` war of the roses '' the remake of `` the hills have eyes '' this is n't one of them -- despite a fun turn by benicio del toro in the emily blunt role from `` prada '' and some interesting work by spacey and michelle forbes this is a frustrating mean confused and slightly dull creation of self- indulgence from a director who has one hopes `` worked it all out '' by now ...,0
i absolutely loved this film ... so much emotion in such a small amount of time i loved the beginning and how it completely throws you off guard i love the story and the deer being brought in i know that when i think of deer i think of innocence and prosperity also in psalm 42:2 in the bible it says `` as the deer pants for the water brooks so pants my soul for you o god '' which could even connect the last moment when the woman says it will be okay as if she knows she 's going with god perhaps i am thinking way to much into it but sometimes it is interesting to see what goes on through peoples minds thank you for sharing this masterpiece with viewers everywhere i live in texas and i had it playing on cable ... i immediately got onto the computer to find out more about this film and this amazing director i really liked the music that was used in the background music can sometimes make or break a film it definitely set the mood perfectly very nice choice thanks again laetitia,1
the 1970s opened the door to the largest most diverse era of film in the history some films were great `` the godfather '' `` the conversation '' `` mean streets '' chinatown '' `` the french connection '' `` five easy pieces '' `` jaws '' `` mccabe and mrs. miller '' others were not so great `` the getaway '' `` the outfit '' `` badge 373 '' `` joe '' `` the taking of pelham one two three '' `` brewster mccloud '' `` castle keep '' and others were barely worth the price of admission yet every one was a fresh breath of air compared to today 's corporate hollywood where every film is given a big weekend to recoup its cost or go straight to hbo and rental what `` decade '' does so well is to relate the sudden and rarely experienced sensation of freedom to be given money to make and direct a film perhaps personal perhaps not sometime with a clutch of extras sometimes in the middle of a busy street before the cops show up long before the corporate overseers suits committees and lawyers ever became part of `` the system '' the commentaries are superb especially julie christie and dennis hopper though as you listen you 'll slowly discover just how many big directors today coppola scorsese ron howard dennis hopper peter bogdonovitch got stated as `` roger corman commandos '' working long hours with short pay shooting a film in under a month learning all the steps and tricks of the trade by doing it themselves turning in product that was on-time and under-budget see `` decade '' for its message and for a long and varied list of films to watch made through those wondrously turbulent years though i would not complain if ifc decided to devote another documentary solely to that most under-rated grand pioneer of film roger corman,1
price of honor aka price of power is an ambitious western melodrama light on the action which seeks to tell an old west version of the jfk assassination in 1881 the president travels to dallas and is shot from a window while parading thru town in his carriage corrupt officials have carried out the murder and have a humble slave take the rap our hero the earnest but bland giuliano gemma aims to unravel the conspiracy an engaging story audacious for its subject matter but entertaining despite the paucity of shoot-em-up action the film is a 7 out of 10 despite the poor presentation of the dvd which is overly dark with poor sound look for a good copy,1
my favourite movie of all time this was a flawed piece of work by coppola and seeing the documentary 'heart of darkness made it even more compelling coppola at this point was king of hollywood after making 'the godfather and 'godfatherii and had developed the ego necessary to even dare try to make a movie like 'apocalypse now through sheer arrogance he went to the phillipines with a partial script and thought he would know what he would do when he got there just as captain willard thought he would know what to do once he got to col. kurtz 's compound and just like willard he did n't know what he was going to do once he got there this is such a masterpiece of american cinema beautifully photographed and the river is such a perfect metaphor and backdrop for the story what i like most about 'apocalypse now is that it offers no answers or conclusions consequently because of this open-endedness it infuriates some viewers who like their movies to be much more obvious this movie defies categorization some call it a war movie which it is n't at all really it is more of a personal study of man the best pic about vietnam is 'platoon in my opinion and if a viewer is seeking a retelling of the vietnam war go there first for answers coppola should be commended for his take on the bureaucracy of war which he conveys quite effectively with the meeting with gen.corman and lucas harrison ford and the playmate review the sheer audacity of kilgore makes him an unforgettable character and the dawn attack will always be a hollywood classic it is an almost psychedelic cruise to a very surreal ending which makes it a movie not accessible to everyone very challenging to watch but rewarding as well i could offer my explanations on each scene but that would be totally pointless this movie is intended for interpretation and contemplation as opposed to immediate gratification a little footnote definitely if your a first-time viewer of apocalypse now watch the original version first the 'redux version is i think more intended for the hardcore fan and is more of a curiosity than a 'new and improved version of the movie,1
you do n't have to spend much time watching this made for tv movie or series pilot or whatever it was intended to be to figure out just what lies in store the incredibly bad musical score makes its debut from the start seriously if this is n't the worst theme i 've ever heard i certainly ca n't remember it while the acting talent is available here from jeff bridges to carl betz vera miles and sal mineo the writing is atrocious and the story is contrived filled with insipid stereotypes and an obvious ripoff from ken kesey why must hollywood always present tales from the sixties as if the so-called hippies were all unidimensional morons it 's too bad that such an interesting era in our exceptionally conformist social experience is generally depicted by out and out garbage so that the least offensive of the genre is now accepted as reasonably authentic when almost none of it comes even close to the way things really were the best i 've seen to date is a memoir called looking back by a guy named becker but who else has even heard of it no one in hollywood that 's for sure they 're too busy pushing tripe like this groaner of a movie to bother with reality,0
what can one say about any wilder film other than they are the most human and real stories about people and what drives them bugs them haunts them billy created pictures like paintings that stand forever reflecting the human condition he paints the good and the bad in all of us he also paints with love i ca n't imagine anyone having a list of greatest films without a wilder film on it they will last because they are true i first saw this movie on tv in the 60s when i was a kid and i had to leave the room because i felt tears welling up in me and was embarrassed now i 'm an old man and i still feel the tears welling but do n't leave the room i knew these people and loved them and grew up around them billy preserved them in this film and not in a 'greatest generation way but in a most realistic way that preserved the power of the human spirit,1
you can find an anti-war statement here without looking too hard that layer is hackneyed or you can find a value neutral comment on the madness of war stripped of `` judgement '' that layer is completely uninteresting or you can watch this for the darn good entertainment value of duvall 's one-liners but that 's just a coating for commercial mastication you can try to view this as a 'realistic vietnam war film but ask any veteran and he 'll swat down that notion -- most vets will say it stinks or view it as a 'will he or wo n't he morality play -- nothing rich there either where i found the value was in the superb self-reference coppola needed a container with great enough dimensions the war to fit the greatness of the skilled multi-dimensional actor playing a great man brando the man was as much of a maverick as the kurtz character the studios were uncomfortable with his acting 'method yet he always excelled and won accolades the 'generals are uncomfortable with kurtz 's 'unsound methods in spite of his strategic genius so coppola makes a movie all about brando 's greatness to hammer on the point he places himself in the movie as hopper a manic photojournalist laden with multiple cameras to spout his praises brando himself is only seen in half-light and silhouettes -- brilliant cinematography by storaro that only increases the actor 's power and he goes out like the sacrificial bull to complete the narrative equation oh yes `` the horror ... '' other pieces of interest the great use of point of view camera perspectives including 'being in the firefight long before `` private ryan '' the ground breaking use of sound notably the ominous flanging sweeps and the sonic depiction of an acid trip do n't get caught in the outer layers the rich part you should despoil from this is the brilliant core of sound vision and self-reference,1
anthony minghella 's 'the english patient is a film that takes us back to the golden years of hollywood it is grand and impressive in scale and yet so heartbreakingly intimate in its portrayal of human love and suffering at the 1997 academy awards the film owned the night taking home nine awards from twelve nominations the most decisive cleansweep since bernardo bertolucci 's 'the last emperor in 1988. based on canadian author michael ondaatje 's 1992 booker prize-winning novel of the same name 'the english patient is a touching meditation on life love and loss tracing the history of a critically-burnt man in the aftermath of world war two during the war a man ralph fiennes is discovered in the burning remnants of a crashed plane with his face scarred beyond recognition and with the man seemingly suffering from amnesia he is assumed to be an allied soldier and is simply referred to as `` the english patient '' after the war in the mine-ridden hills of italy a kind nurse hana juliette binoche who has apparently lost everybody close to her remains in a ruined monastery to look after the dying man over time she comes to learn more and more about her `` english patient '' who is actually revealed to be a hungarian geographer count laszlo de almásy rather than losing his memory in the plane crash we learn that this scar-ridden man has perhaps chosen to forget his past both to protect himself from persecution and to cure himself of the tragic memories of his past love via numerous flashbacks we learn of almásy 's former exploits in the sahara desert and his romantic liaison with a married woman katharine clifton kristin scott thomas it 's certainly easy to see why 'the english patient was so successful at the oscars it is such a beautiful film blending the quiet beauty of the italian countryside with the endless golden sands of the desert cinematographer john seale captures the landscape to perfection not since david lean 's magnificent 'lawrence of arabia has a film shown the desert with such beauty and grandeur making particularly good use of sweeping aerial shots from almásy 's plane even in the film 's more intimate moments excellent use of close-ups and lighting capture the emotion of the scene coupled of course with the brilliant performances from all the cast members a long-time favourite actor of mine 'the english patient might just contain ralph fiennes finest performance and considering his history includes such films as 'schindler 's list and 'the constant gardener this is not a complement that is to be taken lightly his count laszlo de almásy is initially a very sympathetic character but as we slowly learn more about his past his likable qualities are eroded by his less-admirable tendencies towards others `` ownership '' is a major theme of the film when asked by katherine what he hates most almásy replies with `` ownership being owned when you leave you should forget me '' however as the relationship progresses and katherine perhaps tries to distance herself from him almásy reveals a hint of arrogance insisting that his love for her somehow entitles him to have her whenever he likes `` i want to touch you i want the things which are mine which belong to me '' juliette binoche who received an oscar for her performance here is excellent as hana the lonesome nurse who fears to love because of the tragedies that have always harmed those close to her after some time of caring for almásy alone she is joined by a dubious canadian thief david caravaggio willem dafoe who lost his thumbs during the war and who suspects that it was almásy who betrayed him to the germans hana also strikes up a tentative romantic relationship with kip naveen andrews an indian bomb-diffuser in the british army however due to her past history hana is afraid that becoming involved with kip will doom him to death particularly considering his very dangerous line of work at 160 minutes in length 'the english patient wonderfully evokes memories of the classic romantic epics of old successfully finding a balance of mystery love joy and tragedy the ending of the film is heartbreaking and sorrowful but also uplifting in its own way whilst some romantic relationships are doomed from the very beginning others have a very good chance of bringing happiness nevertheless in every case it is always better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all,1
one of the more obscure of anthony mann 's westerns the last frontier was also his only cavalry western aside from one brief episode in winchester '73 though naturally he focuses on the outsiders and internal conflicts rather than offering a fordian celebration of comradeship and shared ideals set not in his beloved high country but in the foothills and forests it 's a much more cynical view of life of the frontier in many ways his fort apache without the need to preserve the legend this outpost is made up of misfits failures cowards and the odd competent officer ignored by his superiors badly led while the civil war takes priority and all the best the army has to offer victor mature and james whitmore are the free trappers who find civilisation creeping up on them when they are relieved of their pelts and packhorses by a local tribe aggrieved by the incursion of the cavalry into their territory rather than blame the indians for their losses they decide it 's the army 's fault for building the fort and decide to demand compensation from them ending up joining their ranks as scouts instead but despite the best efforts of guy madison 's amiable and competent acting commander to bring mature into the 19th century and make him fit to wear the uniform the arrival of robert preston 's humiliated colonel eager to revenge himself on the tribe that drove him out of his own outpost  and mature 's clumsy infatuation with the colonel 's wife anne bancroft too much of a blank slate here to do much with the role of a woman who 's tired of being saved by men who think they know what 's best for her  soon drive matters into much darker territory it 's not long before some of the soldiers are busily planning on killing each other both sides trying to goad their subordinates into doing the deed for them little wonder that at one point mature throws away the bluecoat he has long coveted in disgust screaming `` i would have died for this but it 's nothing but a dirty filthy blue rag '' the stallone of his day mature was one of those actors who could surprise you with the odd excellent performance here and there when matched with the right part and the right director this is not one of his better days despite having his most complex part perversely enough as a simple man  well-meaning but drunk violent uneducated and with a unsubtle almost childlike lust for life the part seems designed with burt lancaster in mind with some striking similarities to his character in the kentuckian but robert preston 's ahab-like colonel is clearly the best role determined to resurrect the career he destroyed in a single disastrously suicidal civil war engagement by launching another pointless suicidal campaign against the tribe that added another humiliation to the list that keeps him out of sight and out of mind of the promotion board in his obsession to redeem his career he moves further away from any hope of moral redemption driven as much by his sense of shame at his wife 's sympathy as by the promotion of former comrades he regards as his inferiors he 's beyond salvation but there 's still a recognisable human being in there and one not entirely without a sense of integrity  he genuinely admires madison 's courage in making a futile attempt to get preston 's orders countermanded by their superiors  fatally skewed though it is like its hero the film is a little rough around the edges and boasts one of the most surreal and jaunty title songs of any western but that only tends to make it more interesting and there are plenty of mann 's typically elegant camera moves and plays on perspective while the frontier setting is convincingly harsh and primitive unfortunately the deficiencies of the early cinemascope lenses are very apparent in columbia 's dvd with the image often dark 2.55:1 cinemascope required a huge amount of additional lighting and early scope films show a lot of trial-and-error and grainy,1
if you are looking for the feel-good hit of the summer dark harvest 2 might just be your ticket the production values of this movie are extremely high looks as if it were filmed with a sony handicam and edited using imovie especially the sound effects -- they sound straight off of a `` spooky halloween sounds '' cd the scarecrow from the cover although he does n't appear in the movie and otherwise has no relevance is terrifyingly realistic from beginning to end you 'll watch as a man aimlessly searches for his daughters through a pun intended maize at the climactic ending of the movie you 'll see well ... you 'll have to watch for yourself what i 'm really trying to say here is do n't come within 1000 yards of this movie i rented it because i thought it would be a campy sort of `` troll 2 '' funny but it 's not i cried after i watched this movie because i realized i had spent money on it and i found the 4 i spent on renting it i actually fell asleep for 20 minutes and still knew what was going on,0
title dracula a.d. 1972 director alan gibson cast peter cushing christopher lee stephanie beacham review sometimes movies can be time capsules that transport you back to any given time in this case ... our time capsule is hammers dracula a.d. 1972 which transports us back to a time in which austin powers would have felt right at home the story is about these group of kids were not a gang were a group that love to hang out at a café shop called `` the cavern '' one day johnny alucard hmm strange last name ... wait ... it spells dracula backwards a new member of the group offers the group a new way to get their kicks he offers them a night of black mass and black magic to which they also say `` sure why the hell not it could be fun '' so in no time flat the find themselves resurrecting count dracula from the ashes this movie opens up with a swinging party at some rich doofuses home he knows non of the people at his party yet there they all are partying the night away in his house doing drugs making out and dancing on top of tables the filmmakers made sure that this sequence was completely engulfed in whatever young people considered cool at that time everyone says words like `` way out '' and `` groovy '' and they finish many of their sentences saying `` all that jazz '' so yeah its pretty evident that this is the 70s to top it all off there 's a band that sounds something like `` jefferson airplane '' ... i mean you 'll be drowned in all things 70s and as i watched this i kept asking myself `` how the heck is dracula with his black cape and get up going to fit into all this '' and thats exactly what happens old dracula feels out of place amidst all the partying and the rock and roll and drugs many of the scenes in the film are great .... but sadly the music they decided to add to the proceedings does n't fit at all and completely takes you out of the mood of things something horrifying or scary will be happening on screen and suddenly a bunch of loud trumpets and congos start to beat and your just completely taken out of the horror element that sucked out the atmosphere right out of this movie for me but all in all putting all the distracting 70s music aside an illness that satanic rites of dracula also suffered the movie was pretty good but i will mention this the story was just a re-hash of what we had seen before in taste the blood of dracula in fact the story is damn near identical lets see ... a young lad inherits draculas ring and ashes ... check he then decides to bring dracula back to life with the help of some people who know nothing about what they are getting into ... check black mass to bring dracula back in a desecrated church ... check the list of similarities goes on and on so this movie ai n't very original if you ask me there are a few things that make this movie worth while though for example the fact that the movie is a time capsule to london in the early seventies makes the film entertaining i kept giggling and laughing every time someone spoke in 70 jargon i could n't believe some of the clothes these people wore and the cars they drove it made the movie fun for me but we are here to get spooked were here to see drac kill a few virgins and take his revenge on the house of van helsing did we get any of that well yeah there 's a few good sequences squeezed in there to satisfy old school hammer fans first off there 's the black mass sequence which was above all things satanic they mention the name of many a demon and lots blood is spilled that sequence was awesome but it was messed up by the music in its most crucial moment then there 's draculas actual resurrection which ill admit was great from a visual standpoint some mist comes out of draculas grave and slowly but surely christopher lees silhouette and face emerge from the fog cool shot i loved it we have a cushing and lee face off at the end and i could n't help to laugh at one point when dracula hurls a piece of furniture through the air i laugh because he has done this in every single film since horror of dracula its this hammer tradition where the characters start throwing candle sticks and chairs at each other and i think to myself are n't their more exciting things to show then a bad guy throwing a candle stick at our hero oh well anyhows draculas demise in this one is very similar to all the other hammer draculas before it vampire gets slaked and then we cut to a series of frames until there 's only ashes left all in all an unintentionally funny hammer dracula film its trapped in the 70s and though that makes it a fun watch and its not as horrible as satanic rites of dracula it still does n't gel well with the dracula universe we had come to expect from hammer rating 3 1/2 out of 5,0
like the 5-year old protagonists of his latest opus hayao miyazaki 's `` ponyo '' enchants with its unbridled innocence as though the anime-meister has become a child himself in weaving a narrative that relishes in its simplicity and emits an infectious charm in the process miyazaki recalling his earlier works paints a brightly-colored world obviously geared for the younger audiences and the raw effervescence gleefully strips off the grim thematic elements that distinguish its immediate predecessors ponyo voiced lovably by yuria nara a fish with a young girl 's face making her look like a cuddly child in a pink overgrown halloween costume escapes away from her underwater home and her school of siblings to explore the surface stranded ashore she is rescued by sosuke hiroki doi a five-year old boy who along with his mom risa tomoko yamaguchi resides in a house on the nearby cliff this initial encounter and eventually friendship has a profound effect on ponyo who now wishes to become human but by becoming so inadvertently tips nature 's balance and unleashes a maelstrom on land with sosuke 's help ponyo must pass a test to lift this curse and completely become a human despite the plot lacking the philosophical sophistication of say his most recent `` spirited away '' `` ponyo '' is nothing short of an astounding follow-up characterized by the extremely diligent attention to detail and masterful balancing of the real and the fantastic and of the simple joys and great fears it 's a straightforward tale that though at times stalled by its tendency to ramble like a toddler keeps in tune with its youthful pedigree to magically enthrall `` i will protect you '' sosuke tells ponyo matter-of-factly a childlike assertion not unlike the manner in which miyazaki endows his story with artful spirit,1
let 's be fair there are no rules for scriptwriting so i wo n't say the movie should be something other than it is i 'll just state my opinion ok i really liked the script the way things are told and characters are introduced however i think when a play is adapted to the silver screen it could maybe try and fit this other media since this movie was directed by joão falcão the same man who directed the play it 's not too much of a surprise that the film turned out a bit too theatrical it 's the man 's first movie for cryin out-loud what i 'm saying is there are parts in the film like the city of nordestina which slightly resembles the set of `` hoje é dia de maria '' that feel like we 're not at a movie theater we 're at the theater lines are spoken too formally characters are moving choreographically and the lightening is clearly meant for a stage sure maybe that was the intention but that 's been done on stage wonderful things have been made when adapting a play into a movie the beautiful `` closer '' for instance when i went to see this one though i did n't feel like i was watching a movie but overall it was a good one worth watching it 's a nice love story funny at times and sad at others my vote is a 7,1
i 'm so happy i recorded this on vhs tape when it was featured on master piece theatre this is a movie i can watch again and again like living in the early 1800 's in england is n't hard enough prue is born with a `` hare lip '' and is outcast from birth the people in her village accept her somewhat but always fear that she is `` from the devil 's smithy '' and are quick to turn on her especially when a lot of bad luck befalls her family she is strong and courageous but shies away from kester woodseaves a traveling weaver who catches her eye partly because she fears rejection and also because she thinks he is so virile that he should have a wife who is as lovely as a lily kester is a modern man who does not believe in the superstitions of the time and he speaks his mind and follows his heart the movie stays true to the original story by mary webb and is riveting from beginning to end,1
while i agree completely with drvn below about mary mccormack flopping a milk-bag out on tv the rest of the show is fantastic phil hartman was great in a professorly way teaching the celebs the ins and outs foley 's a nut but in a good way you never know what self depricating humor he 's going to come up with next as for the game play it 's entertaining filled with witty banter and great for any newbie that may have even a passing an interest in the game too bad it is n't on anymore i just checked the schedule all the way to august and it does n't appear to be scheduled for any time in the future bad bravo you deserve a beating,1
take it from me as a camera man who worked for republic studios from 1946 to 1950 and then warners bros and paramount from 1950 to 1993 this is a piece of crap sure it would be great to show it to your favorite friends at a house party but to try to sell this on a dvd is absolutely ridicious i have seen bad acting in my day but this is no acting the hero is almost laughable and he really thinks he is something judging from his comments on the specials i hate to see his fan club the old films did not jive with the action in many of the scenes what the hell was that garden scene with three of worst actresses i never seen a garden on a ship they could not even emote i would not mind it if they could have once ounce of acting but the only one was the guy with the translvanian accent i am sorry but this is not a clever film as some persons are stating i would think horror film buffs would be insulted by this piece of film,0
to think this film was made the year i was born to think people are still having their constitutional rights taken away now in the name of `` homeland security '' to think this movie was intentionally banned from the american public punishment park addresses the political divide in the united states better than any movie i 've ever seen had it been more widely seen would it have changed anything a movie like this is so polarizing it has the potential to cause riots it shakes you up and forces you to take sides it makes you face the issue are you for the people 's right of dissent in a time of war or for the constitution being compromised in the name of `` national security '' the protagonists are forced by the government to race to the american flag in a game that undermines the very ideals the flag stands for the acting is totally convincing so much so i ca n't see any acting going on here at all if this is a scripted documentary it 's more convincing than any reality show on television today punishment park is possibly the most important film ever made it really makes you think,1
apparently shrunken heads was the last movie that julius harris had a role in i have not seen all of his movies but julius harris was in many good movies and i remember him best from `` live and let die '' where he played tee-hee and which was full of voodoo references something that is common here in south florida i always thought live and let die was a great movie because it had some atmosphere and mystique unlike most of the 007 movies in shrunken heads julius harris is back in his voodoo persona he has a great style for mystery and the occult and his part in this movie is excellent sadly the rest of the movie is something of a comedy spoilers three kids who look like they were fired from the cast of the little rascals get killed by a neighborhood hoodlum who looks like he got fired from the cast of fame or as a dancer on dick clark 's american bandstand in other words these kids give low budget another dimension julius harris goes to the mortuary-funeral home cuts off the three kids heads and nobody notices and then takes them to his condominium unit where he has a giant cauldron of boiling liquids the three heads get tossed in along with some herbs spices and voodoo items at some point mr. harris has the ugly little heads on a table and he spills his blood on them and they come to life as talking heads they can fly make jokes roll their eyes and exact vengeance from the evil-doers they usually look pretty funny flying around but the effects are not bad for some reason one of the kids always has a switch-blade in his mouth and he uses it to slice people 's necks and to cut holes into tires this movie is weird and funny but only the first time you see it meg foster is in this movie and she looks fatter than rosie o'donnell and meg plays a masculine leader of the local gangsters strange movie,0
now i watched this when i was hungover one sunday and my auntie and uncle were visiting one day with my 2 cousins one was 11 the other 9 we stuck on the tv and passport to paris had just started my cousins both had said that they watch two of a kind sometimes and i said they could watch the film if they liked since i was in no fit state to get up i just stayed in the living room with them and ended up watching the film i have to say as a person who has no interest in those kinds of tv shows or films i actually enjoyed it ... it must have been the alcohol lol but i do admit it would probably only appeal more to girls aged between 6 and 13 but it was a movie to pass the time there 's always a movie or a show that you do n't think you 'll like but for a laugh you enjoyed it,0
mostly uninvolving biblical mumbo-jumbo that drags on for well over two hours the only thing that saves this film from god 's wreath and there is only one god remember is the unintentionally funny dialog and a good battle scene which comes far too late in the movie for most of the two hours until the action scenes there is too much talking the dialog is so inept that the movie just begs to be spoofed by mst3k george sanders is absolutely awful one of the most animated overly-theatrical performances i 've ever seen brynner is n't much better his stiff wooden acting combined with the horrendous fortune-cookie wisdom utterings make for a rather boring and silly solomon it seems that every time brynner opens his mouth something oh-so wise and ridiculously high-and-mighty comes out to an extent it 's not sanders 's and brynner 's fault because of the crappy comical dialog and the typically biblical one-dimensional characterization but they made little effort otherwise brynner 's accent even reminds a bit of schwarzenegger 's this is not a plus only lollobrigida manages to avoid embarrassing herself by playing the role with more conviction and in an appropriate way which befits a role in such a silly film to describe these biblical characters as one-dimensional would be too give them undeserved credit the characterization is half-dimensional,0
jimmy stewart was a real life pilot wwii flier and a one-star general in the air force and therefore a natural for how real pilots react when they fly when you see the faithful recreation of the actual plane you begin to understand the real-life bravery and courage of lucky lindy when he flew the atlantic solo in 1927,1
i really liked this movie it totally reminds me of my high school days the soundtrack is awesome i am a huge nic cage fan and this is my favorite movie that he is in i love the storyline it is a total love story against the odds kind of thing i think anyone who graduated in the early eighties 1980-1984 should see the movie it totally brought back memories of high school for me,1
the storyline is a ticked off claim jumper made a deal with the devil to find gold and is forced to protect it forever a bunch of friends find the gold and gets talked by the old miner and they 're forced to blow the gold to smithereens in order to send him back to hell i mean seriously ... how did this film not win the oscar for movie of the year what a compelling storyline of late 20 year olds running from a claim jumper straight out of the 1800 's i love how in other movies you ca n't kill the monster but they can knock it out ... this movie they write the monster as completely indestructible the opening of the movie clearly rips off nightmare on elm street part 4 but what the hell not like that movie was a 5 star classic either highlight of the movie is when we 're introduced to a girl who 's never been to school never been out of the town never learned to read or write .... yet speaks perfect english is smoking hot and wears the latest fashion how did the oscar 's miss that ok i 'm done with the bad jokes this movie is pure crap and only watch it if u have nothing better to do and all the spices on the spice rack are in alphabetical order already 2 out of 10,0
the only reason i know this film exists is because i wanted to see what nancy mckeon had been up to since the facts of life ended when i searched her name up came this relatively new tv movie after much investigation i managed to locate a copy was thoroughly disappointed with what i viewed d grade acting poor script terrible fx it was like watching a toned down more stupefied version of day after tomorrow that went for 3 hours despite the long running time the characters remain fairly under-developed we do not care about them in the slightest in most cases are longing for their demise combine that with terrible lighting cinematography you have a real disaster of a film how they con-viced so many `` name '' actors i.e dianne weist randy quaid brian dennehy to appear in such trash is mind-blowing in summary i want those 3 hours of my life back,0
i first saw `` the knowledge '' during a thames television marathon on one of the local independent stations in los angeles back when it was new i enjoyed it very much along with danger uxb that a movie i saw once over twenty year ago should stick so well in my memory is a testament to it 's originality and the quality of the performances by the cast i looked for a dvd copy here in the u.s.a. and found none i finally gambled and bought a uk dvd off ebay and was delighted to find that it has no region code so those of us that would like to see this little gem can get a copy,1
seymour cassel gives a great performance a tour de force his acting as supposed washed up beach stud duke slusarski will always have a place in my heart the film is centered around a nerd who just came to the beach in hopes of honoring his dead brother 's dreams what he gets is lame surf hijinks guys cheating guys fighting and guys getting drunk going to watch surf documentaries with the whole town of la on a friday night duke takes the nerd in and tries to teach him how playing volleyball is like touching a woman next time my woman talks back i will pretend i 'm spiking the ball back to seymour cassel the end of the movie turns into a good drama since the first half of the film really had no point duke plays a wonderful game of volleyball the best he 's played in over ten years the way the scene is shot is beautiful you can feel the heart this man has for the game and the love of being on the beach those five minutes will go down as one of my favorites of all time 3/10 bad to fair the rest of the movie was lame,0

armed and dangerous is not one of the greats of john candy this film about a fired cop who ends up working for a small security system run by the mob is very weak and not very much a comedy there are some moments that i did enjoy like looking at candy in a pilot suit but it does n't seem to matter much armed and dangerous is still a dangerously disappointing dud brought to us by the director of the equally dumb actioner commando what a sad excuse for a comedy 1 out of 5,0
i do love b- horror films i however am generally not a huge fan of `` so stupid it 's funny '' films i had to rate this so highly simply because death bed the bed that eats is so one of a kind and so original there are plenty of question marks plenty of plot holes and the wtf factor is cranked up to 11 but i was really not bored for a second i really could n't call it creepy at any point every minute i was saying to myself `` what the hell is this bed/film going to do next '' i watched this with a friend that is in no way a fan of horror or b- movies and even she was pretty into it the effects were actually very inventive and the colors and atmosphere were quite good it keeps a very consistent and even tone throughout most of the film albeit an incredibly ludicrous consistency and the acting was n't terrible i can see from the point that there are certain inconsistencies in the actions of the bed that make the suspension of belief damn near impossible but the film itself was such a unique and bizarre concept that that fact did n't really bother me seriously for me this film hit that realm of one i will not only never forget but i guarantee i will find myself thinking back on certain scenes in the future does anyone else know of any other films in the inanimate objects that eat people genre totally fantastic,1
travolta thurman the rock vaughn keitel and so on one should think that this star parade of great actors could really heat up this movie but no travolta takes on the role as chili palmer again but this time we have already seen the gangster who tries hes luck in the hard world of movie making its not funny anymore this is a typically problem in hollywood they think that if the first was good the second will be twice as good no the first was original the second cant be hey hollywood try to understand originality cant be duplicated you got to give us a new twist not just the same movie again made with a bigger budget i constantly found my selves hardly laughing when i was watching this movie but still it got a lot of cool actors like harvey keitel james woods vince vaughn and the rock and for that and that only 4/10,0
the melancholy of haruhi suzumiya is an anime that left quite the impression on me partially for the characters many of whom fall into anime fantasy/sci-fi stereotypes but placing these stereotypes in the rather mundane setting of high school is a twist that i appreciated then there 's the somewhat insane titular character who is something else a headstrong almost amoral girl with ridiculous amounts of talent and a secret that she 's not aware of the set-up for the series is a bit of a mind-trip essentially suzumiya unbeknown to herself is a sort of super-powerful being capable of god-like feats of creation and destruction as she can destroy and rebuild reality to her whim our narrator and primary character is kyon a high schooler whose sympathy/curiosity for haruhi appears to cause her to drag him against his will into a club she 's starting to spice up her life because she 's bored with the normal life searching for adventure she claims three more unusual members each with secrets and they all end up being dragged into her crazy schemes there is a bit of crazy but enjoyable philosophic consideration early on as we debate whether the world is merely haruhi 's creation as she gets bored of the old one and whether our characters exist to serve her or serve her to continue to exist or whether they could exist without her it 's a bit of a conundrum but an enjoyable one all the same while sci-fi/fantasy scenarios do occasionally occur in the series i think the joy of the series lies in how normal things are while there remains this tension in knowing that if things are too boring haruhi might destroy the world in hopes of making it more interesting the art is clean and in line with what i 've come to expect from the anime that typically gets imported to the us i like the character designs and while there is n't a whole lot of action in the series i think it sits better that way the series is narrated from the mind of kyon and he does n't play an omniscient narrator but only comments on what he knows and what he feels he 's has a lot going on in his head but he does n't actually speak a whole lot so it 's good that we get to hear it the voice acting in the english dub is acceptable enough but i prefer the japanese acting over it there are some stranger aspects to the series some of which both parodies and traffics in fanboy-ism which i found amusing for the first season i have to admit that there 's a lack of closure as the series does n't really have an larger story arc but seems to take things one at a time so it 's an easy series to pick up and put down although i think that because of its rather entertaining qualities it 's still quite hard to put down it 's also based on a series of light novels and the author was directly involved in the writing of the series even though it 's based on the novels i still wish that the over series had stronger story arcs but i love how naturally we get to watch these characters develop and how well the series can play out the quiet moments as well as the crazier ones seeing haruhi grow herself was quite a treat as well as watching the relationships develop between the sos brigade haruhi 's club it 's not for everyone due to its mind-twisting premise and `` extra-ordinary beings in a mundane world '' setting it probably wo n't sate fanboys who are into action/sci-fi/fantasy and might be a little too off-kilter for the more relationship-oriented drama lovers but for those willing to try out something a little different or that like strangely quirky series like this i think the melancholy of haruhi suzumiya is a rather refreshingly unique and enjoyable series more please 9/10,1
armored the best part about driving an armored vehicle is that if any bums approach you at a red light asking for money you can shoot them in the face and while the armoured guards in this thriller are n't using their protective power to purge the drifter population they are using their position to fleece their employer when newcomer ty columbus short lands a job with an armored trunk company he feels like he has found his lot in life unfortunately however when he discovers that his co- workers matt dillon jean reno and laurence fishburne are plotting to take the 42 m shipment for themselves ty must fortify himself  and the funds  inside the armored truck a tedious caper with a plodding plot and phoned-in performances armored is an utterly forgettable film besides if you really want to jack millions it 's a lot simpler to just disguise yourself as an atm red light,0
i completely disagree with the other comments i too saw this film at an early screening and found it quite enjoyable robin williams is in top form true the tone is familiar but it is williams of good morning vietnam smart funny on point after too many dark turns williams is finally back to what he does best the supporting actors give great performances especially laura linney and chris walken chris plays himself as usual but as the `` agent '' to the next president he was a delight each time on screen lewis black plays only himself basically but he is wonderfully well used here there is also a fun turn by jeff goldblum the movie is more than what the trailer suggests as well the movie is funny but it is not a pure comedy as suggested it has a bit of a thriller line which everyone should seriously consider especially if you pay attention to the newspaper,1
this is one you can watch over and over and laugh just as much each time we have been on a keaton fest around here after purchasing some of his films in this one buster is mistaken for an escaped murderer and there are lots of chase scenes and crazy scenes but also what is best about buster his creativity the opening scene is really funny and it just keeps going from there,1
this is one of four 1970s movies by tv writer lane slate about sensationalistic murders in small towns they feature likable tv personalities as police chiefs and quirky characters as town regulars including light-touch love interests the others are they only kill their masters james garner 1972 and the girl in the empty grave and deadly game both andy griffith 1977 alda 's is set near vermont `` mount angel '' next to `` horse creek '' the others in california garner 's at seaside `` eden landing '' and griffith 's in the mountains `` jasper lake '' all try to capture the feel of a small town to move at a relaxed pace among comfortable characters and to tell a mystery with at least some complicated twist or turn to it on that level they are somewhat entertaining that they were often re-run itself suggests they have some appeal but they suffer from overall thin stories and dialogue slack pacing bland settings flat or exaggerated characters and off-putting forced attempts often juvenile or crude at color or humor alda 's and garner 's are the most serious about story characters pacing and tone they have the best supporting casts though alda 's is put to better use the griffith casts pale in comparison alda 's has the best director `` shocking '' has some surprise and drama the killer 's method is inventive the tone is more even and the dialogue more natural than in griffith 's alda 's film does not suffer like the others from smug big-city transplants to the town or from hokey exaggerated local characters both of which come across as figments of a hollywood scriptwriter not as genuine the worst offender is the griffith movies pipsqueak mumbling moron `` whit '' who we are told tried to hook a jeep up to and make off with a trailer serving as a temporary bank branch dragged away the dock for the police boat stole tomatoes from a farmer 's truck only to get nothing for them and filled out 11 on the withdrawal slip of `` spiro t. babylis '' only to be discovered by the teller mercifully absent is the clunky heavy-handed repetitive-style dialogue from the griffith movies `` you going to lunch '' `` i 'm going to take out the boat '' `` you going to take the boat to lunch '' `` i 'm not going to lunch '' `` you 're not going to take the boat to lunch `` `` there are n't any fish in this lake why are you fishing here '' `` it 's illegal in horse mountain '' `` it 's posted here too you 're breaking the law '' `` some law there are n't any fish in this lake '' `` then why are you fishing here '' `` i told you it 's illegal in horse mountain `` `` please call me lloyd my name is lloyd '' `` okay lloyd ... '' `` call me lloyd that 's my name my name is lloyd '' but alda is too low-key and unimpressive to be taken seriously as even a small-time police chief certainly not a red-hot lawman in demand by a rival town slate has the character admit as much when he comes late to the scene of a by then obvious clue as a result of an accidental name recognition rather than detect or investigate barnes strikes out blindly in emotional denial his secretary lasser feeds him a key clue `` why did n't i think of that '' he says an embarrassing funeral scene plus a plot contrivance leads to another gift clue worse barnes is more interested in deriding the military-style helmets of the county police sent to help him deadly game also suggests slate has something against the military than leading them or his own men effectively he allows a late murder by incompetently guarding a known target barnes allows his car to be repeatedly rammed by the killer fleeing one crime scene without drawing his gun or trying to take control again he is ineffective and nearly killed in the climactic scene which results from multiple errors on his part that are only partially corrected by accident the erratic northeastern accent that alda affects does not help believability there are plot holes why would the killer strike after all these years and committing the first two murders without a trace seems implausible but they are nothing compared to later ones -- a couple together a shopkeeper in his store during business hours a fully clothed deputy seated in his office and unbelievably his dog alda 's movie also suffers from some offensive elements that slate injects into all the movies barnes first appears in a motel clerk 's bed he then treats her rudely at every turn and insults and tries to avoid her kids this and talk about the female doctor smack of a crude mean-spirited pattern garner 's film has been described as `` sleazy '' including a scene where he and a deputy laugh about how a girl in the back seat of a car that hit a bump in the road had part of her anatomy bitten off by a guy in the car with her griffith 's feature an ersatz ropers routine in which the woman embarrassingly tries to coax the man into `` the supply closet '' a gratuitous locker-room-type exchange with a deputy in discussing a young woman 's car accident death `` did you take her out '' `` i took her in once `` a reference to bank teller `` bernice '' as `` swollen-up in places '' and to `` sticking a pin in '' her and to `` hating '' and firing secretary `` maude '' because she was `` too hairy '' a description of the female doctor 's practice as `` two stirrup tables and a flashlight '' a humiliating scene in which fran ryan propositions griffith offering `` some home grown '' and an insulting subplot in which a woman pursued by a deputy played as a drippy buffoon seems to `` sleep around '' finally alda 's film has a grim bleached-out colorless lifeless look and feel only louise lasser adds spark at least the other films had some spirit scenery and pleasant music griffith 's got out onto the mountainside onto the lake and even out into the big city you feel more like re-watching masters or empty grave than shocking,0
this is the worst work ever of daniel day lewis ..... i can not believe that in the same year he made this awful movie and my left foot ..... please stay away from this movie .... this is a movie only for argentine people as a curiosity ... the plot is impossible to understand ...... the writer thinks that in argentine all the people speaks in english ... of course the patagonia bring a very good frame for the photo shooting of the film but that is not enough reason to see this movie .... i repeat only if you are very fan of daniel day lewis or if you want to see the south of argentine part of the patagonia and you do not have enough money to travel yourself .......,0
`` when a killer calls '' is an unusually nasty slasher flick with some very unpleasant and unsettling sequences the decision was clearly made to try and cash in on the remake of `` when a stranger calls '' by pretty much putting in -- almost word for word -- the phone call sequences from that movie they seem very forced additionally the filmmaker commits the cardinal but all too common sin of having the heroine 's friends being repulsive jerks so for the beginning of the film we really like and are rooting for the babysitter a nice believable job by rebekah kochan but then she 's joined by standard slasher-flick teenage friends and the mood is ruined the flick sort of works but it probably a lot more unpleasant than you 'll be expected so be fore-warned,0
before i talk about the ending of this film i will talk about the plot some dude named gerald breaks his engagement to kitty and runs off to craven castle in scotland after several months kitty and her aunt venture off to scottland arriving at craven castle kitty finds that gerald has aged and he has grown meaner gerald has certain rules for the castle the rules have been the same for 200 years gerald does not want them to stay but kitty insist on staying by making excuses one night her aunt catches a glimpse of the monster running across the hall it scares her so much that she faints and another excuse they must stay longer kitty becomes more worried about gerald after she tries to go in the maze but gerald catches her and is even meaner to her kitty then sends for reinforcements she calls their doctor who is actually their friend and his wide then to make things not look suspicious they invite a couple other friends who do n't really do anything blah blah blah kitty and her aunt end up in the maze where the most suspense of the story is they somehow get separated and they try to find each other but the aunt stumbles upon the creature ... here it is the moment we 've all been waiting for what is the creature lurking in the shadows ... it is a giant frog omg what is better than that after seeing the aunt the frog literally goes crazy and runs oops i mean hops up the stairs to the top of the castle the frog then leaps out an open window we then go on a shot from the ground and see the frog gall towards us oh yeah this movie was in 3-d but you want to know what is funny is the frog that falls out the window is actually a toy because it is 1/10 the size of the frog before it takes the leap it is then revealed that this was all evolutions fault blah blah and kitty and gerald get married then the last shot of this masterpiece is of the grave of the frog in the maze the only place where he was ever really happy,1
after seeing this piece of crap you will know why the limeys drive on the left side of the street ... this movie is an absolute no-brainer the jokes if this is the right word for it ... are mostly sub-standard about 98 and do miss any punch-line at all save the money and get drunk you might enjoy this movie being totally wasted perhaps,0
feeling minnesota is one of the worst films i have ever seen it is also one of the most disgusting films ever made it has to do with a woman who is forced to marry a disgusting mob man at the wedding she meets his brother jjaks they have sex in the house after they eat the cake than decide to run away together the other brother of course comes after him guns blazing and he kills his wife jjaks wakes up to find her corpse in the bathtub and buries her he than seems to become friends with jjaks and they try to get money together because someone is blackmailing them because he saw them and the body this loops about and several characters dies or come back to life but it never comes together with anything that could be called a good plot the performances are horrible by pretty much everybody cameron diaz keanu reeves and dan akroyed the direction dialogue and visual effects are just horrible a disgusting and horrible movie,0
i rented this movie because it supposedly takes place in a jazz club -- you know those hip cool places you might stumble upon late on a saturday night well there 's not one ounce of `` cool '' in this ridiculous movie the score is goofy the original songs are awful both lead actors singing is continually off-key to be kind and unprofessional at best the plot is no more complex than `` boy meets girl '' the acting is laughable and the only decent cinematic moments are the stock footage scenes the jazz club scenes feature sophomoric dialog smothered by overly-busy organ music this joey de francesco should keep his day job unless his day job is helping with movie scores is it possible to not only get my four dollars back but have my therapy sessions paid for as well this movie interestingly enough is so bad you might want to watch it sort of like driving by a bad accident -- you just have to look at least once just get the ear plugs ready,0
centres on czech ww2 pilots  the older frantisek the boyish impulsive karel and in the background the quiet piano-playing honza as the film opens it is 1950 the war is over and frantisek and honza are imprisoned in a former monastery in their now soviet-controlled native country they are 'enemy of the people honza is severely maltreated by his communist countrymen and dies in 1939 many pilots manage to escape german-occupied europe and make their way to england where they join the raf notwithstanding their high motivation and experience they face raf reluctance and british stiff upper lip finally they fight gallantly in the battle of britain however frantisek and karel find their friendship severely tested when they both fall for the same woman in terms of romantic sub-plot this is very similar to the hollywood production pearl harbour however given the context of the film and frantisek 's eventual fate it is also possible to read the english woman 's treatment of the two men as symbolic of british treatment of the czech and polish raf pilots conveniently forgetting them once the war is over in addition the film is a lot less cliché than pearl harbour and the characters are more fully realised dark blue world also scores in terms of its stunning aerial dogfights which were seamlessly created using a mixture of models actual live-action aerial filming and out-takes from the 1969 epic the battle of britain in short dark blue world is a well-made moving thought-provoking and exciting drama that puts the likes of pearl harbour to shame highly recommended,1
so as far as i gather this episode is trying to make a statement about how real-life villains are very bad people and this is just as scary as the paranormal the `` paranormal '' imagery associated with the villain donnie is purely symbolic he 's actually just a normal human being the problem is that i just do n't buy it donnie is simply not scarier than the paranormal he 's not even that scary at all as a guy who seems confused and weird rather than malicious likes dead girls and hair and has only newly become a murderer he 's significantly less disturbing than most well-known real-life serial killers eg he 's like a very watered-down version of ed gein which is why scully 's horror at seeing nothing but bodies with hair and nails cut off something not too different from a normal personal hygiene routine before anybody has even been killed or hurt at all is completely out of character she sees things a hundred times worse in almost every other episode and hardly flinches so as comic book guy says ... `` worst episode ever '',0
i have seen this movie but not in a single sitting what happens it that it is playing on the tv i watch for a few minutes find that i have take all that i can take and then leave the room during those few minutes i do not laugh once experience no pleasure in what i am viewing and find myself more depressed that angry interestingly i am told the psychological states are incompatible that is one can not be angry and depressed at the same time this movie tests that theory i think part of the problem is that i spent nearly ten years in chicago so as i am watching the scenes i am thinking of my own experiences in that rotten town and thus i am clearly bringing a lot of my baggage to the piece it is entirely possible i am willing to concede that if you are not a chicago denizen you will find the piece amusing if so i envy you and yet john hughes set his films in chicago and those movies worked for me i think the difference is that hughes was a first rate writer i think it obvious he knew how to comically balance his situations as well as make his characters both sympathetic and believable in a comedy as distinguished from a farce this balance vital and it is not easy to achieve if it was everyone would be making great movies and we would not have to fret as we do in the real world wondering when genius will ever appear in `` adventures in babysitting '' it does n't i hated those characters there is a difference profound and real between sympathetic and simply pathetic for me every scene in this movie is a clunker there is no humor no humanity no people one can recognize just actors reading their lines as if it all they can do to restrain themselves from screaming them out certain that finally hilarity will ensue this time for sure it 's like watching the antics of very bad comedians it 's embarrassing and after a while usually at the point when i get up and leave i start to feel pity for all concerned which is a kind of emotional connection i suppose elizabeth shue is terrible she does n't act certainly not act comically and it 's entirely possible she ca n't but lord how she tries she looks older than 17 and acts way younger like a seven-year old straining in a school play certain that this is how one gets an award and she is not alone it is as if everyone can not relax and let the tale flow as if everyone simply has no idea what they are doing now this was an early effort for chris columbus and he clearly would improve and having better writers e.g john hughes himself certainly helped so perhaps some forgiveness is in order but the film just reeks of desperation yet like i said it may work for some if any of the above appeals to you and it clearly did some of the reviewers then go get the dvd and knock yourself out otherwise avoid this mess like you would a dark chicago alley where as you hurry by you can only see shadows and hear muttered threats,0
i 'm bout it 1997 developed published by no limit films pros absolutely none cons i do n't even know where to begin plot summary master p plays a drug dealer that looks talks and acts more like a live-action cartoon character that 's all the plot i got out of this movie review i remember back when i was in the ninth grade during its release and everyone in my class praised this clown called master p. this movie is so bad it 's not even funny all the characters in this film are extremely tired stereotypes the audio is only audible when music plays and the movie looks like it was videotaped off a public access channel luckily i did n't buy this film like all my other inner-city degenerate classmates my rating:1 out of 10 my verdict avoid this video like its a sexually-transmitted disease,0
when i bought this film i expected to get a fun 1970 's exploitation film instead i got this bore fest by amateur auteur andy milligan ah andy milligan with his tight editing breakneck pacing and wonderfully well known actors you 'd almost think you 're watching ... one of his home movies seriously i could n't even stay awake the first time i tried to watch it the scenes of boring people dragged on an on and whenever someone got killed the film would slow down sometimes it would speed up too making the characters voices sound like chipmunks which was probably the best thing about this film the script actually seemed a bit better than the film and seems more well suited to be in a soap opera than in a grainy 70 's sleeping pill where the actors constantly stumble over it 's lines the cover said `` their prime cuts were curiously erotic ... but thoroughly brutal '' trust me there is nothing `` erotic '' about this film oh we do get to see characters that resemble extra lumpy cottage cheese making out but that 's about it and as far as `` brutal '' well the viewer is brutalized the most with this here film and another thing ...,0
this very low-budget film is fun if you 're a john krasinski fan but is otherwise disappointing at least it was short so i did n't feel like i had wasted too much of my time john 's scenes are funny enough but the attempted 'deep scenes with lacey chabert are pretty nauseating it starts off seeming like it could be a funny movie but some of the characters are just so outlandish while the others are far too serious that it just falls flat do n't get me started on the ending it was totally implausible and did n't even fit with the rest of the movie i will say that i was n't bored though which is why i rated it above a three fans of john krasinski will enjoy seeing him with a bandanna and stockings around his head and eating cheez-its oh and make sure to check out john 's deleted scenes they 're better than some that were actually included in the movie,0
it was probably watching this tv movie that got me interested in the debate as to whether `` anna '' was really tsar nicholas 's daughter anastasia since seeing it i have made a point of watching various documentaries and also bought a book despite the evidence that has been discovered since the film was released i sometimes still think she was such is the power of amy irving 's acting in this 2-parter which is somewhat liberal with the historical facts but packed to the brim with tear-jerking drama and irving 's totally convincing performance i was not consciously aware of irving before this though i must have seen her without realizing it in `` carrie '' another favourite film in `` anasasia '' i never felt for one moment that `` it 's only a film '' for me this woman was anastasia and when part one ended with her in the railway carriage meeting members of the royal family i knew that come hell or high water i had to see the second part i just wanted to see how she would prove that she was who she claimed to be and as the story progressed i felt an intense hatred of rex harrison 's character though i greatly admire him as an actor when i saw the movie listed again in the tv guide i convinced my mother that we should watch it and afterward she thanked me for doing so being almost as keen as i had been to watch part 2. then i bought the video and can totally recommend it `` anastasia '' is one of those rare tv movies that you simply must watch for the sheer enjoyment of watching the finest acting i have ever seen on tv and it does n't really matter whether you believe the legend or not,1
i love movies in this genre beautiful girls toilet humor gratuitous nudity so why did n't i like this movie no movie like this should add even the slightest confusion to the plot who 's who where is the money it 's not se7en just make me laugh maybe it 's me but i never felt this frustrated watching american pie movies or any other more modern national lampoon 's movies this movie has no flow that keeps me smiling waiting for what 's next instead i find myself stopping to think `` why did they keep that scene '' i do not recommend this movie if you are expecting van wilder think again the only fun i had watching this movie was guessing what movies the actors were in when they were kids 2/10 generously,0
i agree with so many of the other reviewers here this was a great film and an even better novel by robert fish unfortunately i believe the author died before he could see this film made the performances are all top rate with the three principles john glover ben cross and veronica hamel seemingly made for their roles the exteriors both in europe and israel seem very authentic and the 4-hour miniseries length was just right for the telling of this story fortunately i did tape this when it was on television and have enjoyed watching it ever since i can say unhesitatingly that it holds up even to this day i gave it a rating of 10. if you have n't read the book you should really find a copy this would be an outstanding film to release on dvd with extras that could easily include interviews from the cast,1
this is my first `` awful '' rating ever on imdb and i could n't think of a more deserving film to honor it with i hoped for entertaining trash and found trash of the saddest dullest kind i found a film which no one can possibly have cared a bit about including its creator `` hell ride '' directed written by and starring larry `` friend of qt '' bishop has a simple plot about a hidden treasure and a trio of keys two bands of bikers and a gruesome murder in 1976 which has yet to be avenged larry seems fiercely determined not to tell this story focusing instead of putting his swaying strangely grimacing main character into situations where he can fondle women who pretend to like it he also has a dialog containing enough horrible fire puns/metaphors to put one off the word `` fire '' for life dennis hopper escapes complete humiliation others are not so lucky sometimes they hit the road on their bikes making one feel even more sorry for michael madsen since his high handles seems to add insult to the injury of having to appear in this film there is plenty of silicon-enhanced nudity but fairly little action and no humor whatsoever making one wonder just what kind of an audience they had in mind my guess is that most people who watch this film including fans of trashy 60s biker movies will feel cheated do yourself a favor and revisit the real stuff instead,0
by dane youssef i was kind of looking forward to this one i enjoy eddie murphy and i love it when a star hand-makes a vehicle for themselves or when someone who writes decides to mark their own directorial debut but when the star 's head gets too big for the rest of his body there 's always a danger of a big-budgeted hollywood vanity production will the filmmaker keep it real or will he just waste amounts of money the studio 's ours and time the studio 's ours his own patting himself on the back for an hour in a half sadly it 's the latter here another thing i really like is when someone breathes new and fresh life into an exhausted and dried-out genre none of that here the warring nightclub movies have become so worn-through that even the parodies of it are dreary and done to death murphy does neither he does the most clichéd he plugs into a routine conventional formula gangster picture and plays it as seriously as if it were `` the godfather '' it 's like a script where the next draft they put in the jokes and the new ideas but it seems like someone with clout just looked at it and went `` no this is fine '' probably murphy he is credited all over this in the opening shot of beautiful white satin sheets his name headlines across the credits about five times the plot a young orphan saves pryor 's life and pryor adopts the little ragamuffin 20 years later pryor 's dump has become a first-class hot spot they 're pulling down big money and a gangster wants their action he 's even got a dirty cop in his employ but pryor comes up with a scheme a la `` the sting '' murphy 's screenplay plays like an unfinished first-draft that nobody had the pair to call him on the actors are n't really allowed to stand-out much if at all even the almighty murphy seems to be on auto-pilot pryor shows class and gentlemanly manners as sugar ray perhaps it would have been better to name his character brown sugar rayfurther evidence that this one needed a polish but everyone here is basically just on vacation the oscar-nomination the movie received is richly deserved joe i. tompkins best costume design but the production values are the only part that makes the '30 's feel authentic some sets look somewhat fake but this is supposed to be a comedy of sorts it 's rare one movie gets nominated for both a razzie and an oscar unless it 's one of lucas new `` star wars '' chapters it 's 1938 and everyone is talking like it 's 1988 particularly the comedians this is a prehistoric white man 's formula and with all these black comedians and satirists you expect them to skewer the genre or at least bring new life to it nope murphy is pretty much just coasting here the great roger ebert summed it up perfectly when he remarked in his review `` murphy approaches his story more as a costume party in which everybody gets to look great while fumbling through a plot that has not been fresh since at least 1938 '' jasmine guy is perfectly cast and seems to be indulging herself in her role and michael lerner has all the looks evil and mannerisms of the prototypical mob boss down pat and there are moments where pryor gives you an idea of what a more interesting leader and authority figure would sound like he gives every scene he 's in a feeling of dignity would it have been too much to ask that della resse sing or at least quit embarrassing herself with all her `` kiss my ass talk '' and the late redd foxx does n't get to leave much of a swan song here he has some back-and-forth with resse which could have been some great stuff nope murphy wastes another opportunity again here murphy 's quick is charismatic and likable but those moments are few and far between for sure murphy has never looked better and never been duller his character made me laugh twice throughout the whole movie stan shaw 's boxer with a horrible speech impediment is n't just painful and embarrassing it 's annoying there 's more to comedy than simply showing something unpleasant you have to incorporate some kind of light touch and funny situation watching him strain even the some of the easiest words just makes us feel sorry for him and annoyed with murphy can murphy write a screenplay well there was `` raw '' but that was really stand-up material he wrote the outline for `` boomerang '' and `` coming to america '' for sure but her did n't have the last word there maybe a team of er-like script doctors could 've revived this one murphy 's direction is so slow and quiet you 'd swear he was asleep at the wheel some of the time he has too many static shots and does n't seem to know how to build and release suspense on some level i think quick is the real eddie murphy angry young hot-headed and ambitious but occasionally charming now if he were only funny sometime there 's a scene in which murphy has a femme fa-tale in bed who plans to make love with him and kill him you can probably guess how it turns out like everything else in the movie this could have been better but `` surprisingly '' murphy has not directed another movie since he got a razzie nomination and he no longer writes the finished draft for his films either he won the razzie for writing this it 's great to look at and the music is beautiful and there are a few really nice scenes but that just falls under the category of `` gems among all the junk '' not enough of them couldv e been shouldv e been was n't oh well by dane youssef,0
if regarded as an independent feature i ca n't say it 's too bad at all but from where i 'm standing this sequel and the original `` lady and the tramp '' do n't agree with each other they are two completely different movies with different style different voice personalities different narratives and about the only thing that they share with each other is the visuals e.g the town-house of jim dear darling lady and tramp and none of those have changed if you 're seeking any kind of continuity years after the release of the original for those memorable songs like `` bella notte '' and `` the siamesse cats song '' this sequel wo n't give you any at all just about every song has a little pop to it and those good old characters like jock and trusty jim dear and darling and aunt sarah and her cats may well be seen but they 're seeming to be somehow replaced by new characters not to mention peg not appearing at all whose voices are quite annoying even lady and tramp do n't appear often enough and as for scamp he is so spoilt and treats his father tramp with utter disrespect then runs away with no remorse even after hearing how much he 's being missed at home and they called his shameless getaway an adventure i 'd say scott wolf truly brought out the abusive bad boy in scamp wiping out the typical cute disney animal even the old characters just drive you mad in this trusty sounds like goofy sick in bed jock jeff-stupid-bennett and his voice sound neither scottish nor worth hearing zap him off as far as possible to free our poor ears from his voice and as for the dumb feather-brained exasperating junkyard dogs somebody put them down `` lady and the tramp 2 '' is n't completely bad if you 're not already having a tough day but i expect a lot more charm from a sequel to a true classic scamp is chavvy so is his girlfriend angel and there is a feeble storyline still i think you should try it at least once because as i say there are much worse movies around,0
good not great little horror film with a high `` creep '' factor not to be confused with a 1991 movie by the same name or the more recent 2001 campfire stories central tale of stranded teens telling ghost stories around a campfire in spooky woods nicely leads into and ties together the different stories that make up the bulk of the movie watch for ron livingston office space band of brothers and jennifer macdonald in a spirited sexy segment `` the honeymoon '' solid acting and a few truly `` scary '' moments make this an above-average chiller good example of interesting story line coupled with quality ensemble acting resulting in a whole greater than the sum of its parts `` surprise '' ending of the main story adds nice creepy twist although some may see it coming movie is not available on dvd but can be found on vhs,1
crackerjack is a funny movie everyone at the bowlo has seen it and all say the same the wheel of cheese was a great part of the movie also the loud speaker `` dear mr so and so you have left you right indicator on '' or when jack goes home and lays down on the couch and cracks a beer `` bowls is hard work '' cracked me up and when his roommate shows interest by joining the club and calling bingo number jack buying all the raffle tickets to win the meat tray bloody great movie if you are into lawn bowls as you can relate to it if your not a lawn bowler forget it i think the evans head bowlo would rate as the best club in aus friendly people great company.hi to evans head bowlo steve,1
once again seeing this kind of movies turns me more and more into english humor not too often seen on screen since the days of monty python and man about the house too bad brenda blethyn who i first saw in saving grace early in the year another must see by the way just excels as alfred molina does the rest of the cast while virtually unknown to me turns on great performances too the film starts slowly and gradually gains in pace and amusement midway i had tears in my eyes from laughing all in all a funny english movie a thousand times better than the supposedly 'funny garbage that comes from hollywood,1
eisenstein 's first sound film retells the battle of the ice of 1242 when the russians under alexander nevsky defeated the livonian knights eager to bring russia under roman catholicism made in 1938 nevsky can be seen as a piece of propaganda the germanic knights with their sinister and somewhat goofy helmets are obvious stand-ins for the nazis the butchery by the knights when they enter a russian town seems a prophetic warning of the massacres of world war ii the film ends with a warning those who came to russia with the sword will die by the sword made in delicate black and white somewhat reminiscent of a daguerreotype it also marked eisenstein 's return to official favor by the late 1920s stalin wanted soviet filmmakers to stop experimentation and made movies that would be more populist and palatable to the russian public that stopped eisenstein 's career in russia for a decade and in nevsky he came back with his more accessible film nevsky 's strong point is in its second half which features the battle itself and it is justly seen as a milestone in movie history never before and probably never after a battle would be so vivid in the screen another strong point is prokofiev 's beautiful haunting soundtrack using a composer to score a movie was completely unusual at the time one of its weaker points the comic relief in the form of two simpleton russian warriors trying to woo a beautiful russian peasant is really jarring,1
this was one of the dullest movies i have seen in some time i 'm in my late 40s and watched it with my son-in-law early 20s and son 17 the scenery was beautiful but the story was a bust we watched about an hour of it and turned it off i spent more time on my iphone during the hour that we watched it than i spent actually watching the movie i gave it a 3 because i enjoyed the scenery and cinematography otherwise i would have given it a 1. i 'm sure there are people who are really into the `` art '' of it all who will find my review appalling but we 're all entitled to our own opinions right i could n't figure out if this was supposed to be a `` chick flick '' where the focus was on the mother or if it was supposed to be a movie for guys with the focus on battle and adventure in my opinion it did n't succeed in either,0
i only wish there was a grade lower than f to give it i scored it a 1 in the vote tally.i am grading this not even as a regular film but as a t a film and this is the worst lamest crappiest and most awful movie i 've seen.the acting story and music are all terrible not to mention there is n't even any nudity for the t a connisuer.it 's about a male cheerleader and the viewer is made to sit through many painful scenes of him doing cheers.avoid this piece of trash at all cost this is the worst of bad 80 's teen cinema,0
to most of us life is an unfolding process of love for others like soo-mi however it is dominated by darkness and fear based on the korean folk tale jangha and hongryun kim ji-woon 's brilliant gothic horror story a tale of two sisters revolves around two sisters soo-mi lim su-jeong and soo-yeon mun geon-yeong who are part of a dysfunctional family that live together in a creepy victorian-style mansion feeling alienated from the world they cling to each other for survival with the older soo-mi obsessively protecting the younger soo-yeon against danger for soo-mi however not coming to terms with the circumstances surrounding her mother 's death means mental illness and a mind at odds with reality while we may recognize staples such as haunted houses with apparitional sightings doors that open and close on their own a cruel and overbearing stepmother and other events of high strangeness a tale of two sisters superbly explores deeper psychological meanings including the inability to let go of inner demons and the misplaced desire for revenge soo-mi says `` do you know what 's really scary you want to forget something totally wipe it off your mind but you never can it ca n't go away you see and ... and it follows you around like a ghost '' there is a time line but it is left for the viewer to unravel the plot can not be summarized only suggested and the film keeps us wondering whether what is happening on screen is objective or subjective in the film 's opening soo-mi an obviously disturbed young woman is being questioned by a doctor in a setting that looks like a mental institution when the doctor asks her to describe what happened `` that day '' the film flashes back to when soo-mi and soo-yeon return to the home of their father moo-hyeon kim kap-su and stepmother eun-joo yum jung-ah the stepmother is hostile and resentful and the father is passive and distant but it is obvious that it is soo-mi who is really hurting as the girls try to readjust they are constantly frightened by a presence in the house which may be nightmares or supernatural occurrences soo-mi sees a figure at the foot of her bed that hovers over her and oozes black blood a dinner scene in which the guest apparently sees a ghost hiding under the sink and goes into convulsions a monster emerges from between the legs of one of the sisters people mysteriously disappear from photographs and many other maniacal schizophrenic devices to keep the viewer dangling on the edge of insanity while we sense that much of the story is the projection of someone 's mind we do not know whose and the film keeps us constantly challenged at least until an important clue is offered in the film 's second half shot in gorgeous low-light cinematography a tale of two sisters has a unique elegance and other worldly beauty that transcends all the scares and there are plenty it is haunting in more than one sense of the word and its images may stare back at you when you least expect or want them to while the film may not offer the weary traveler much in the way of light it shows us where we can end up if we opt for the darkness in the words of a wise observer `` blame is never the answer whether it is blaming yourself or others rather the answer lies in stepping out of judgment entirely both of yourself and others forgiveness and understanding have great power of healing '',1
the spoof genre which has lacked creativity and humor for some time already gets spat upon yet again by hacks with no talent no point no fun no originality just a few cheap bucks for the film makers it takes more than just referencing some recent movies and giving characters double-meaning names to be satire to make people laugh any clod can pick up a cam-corder and have some bad-acting buddies in cheap costumes imitate somebody since the genre being targeted this time is inspirational sports movies there are a few lame references thrown out to movies of that type the jokes are so weak the characters actually have to emphasize the references in various ways to get you to laugh hysterically it does n't work that 's not comedy however the same old worn out sophomoric `` jokes '' ripped off from a middle school washroom done even more blandly than usual are all here if that 's not enough there 's a running `` gag '' of a bus running somebody over so funny right also one pathetically poor scene does more product placement than michael bay again with the same unfunny results a musical bit flops miserably pity carl weathers once apollo creed in the rocky series now stuck with roles in swill like this lousy beyond words watching a snail run the marathon would be less tedious than watching this film is probably a lot funnier too,0
good attempt at tackling the unconventional topic of may-december romances however the treatment is totally unrealistic sure sixty-year old men can and do fall for younger women but they 're usually adult women with whom they share common interests and values and viewpoints ... not neurotic immature near-underage girls of course there are exceptions and they come close to being called pedophiles sorry rgv but it 's not credible that a sane and accomplished sexagenarian would throw away a comfortable family life and become a joke to his peers ... all for an 18-yr old that does n't have a practical thought in her head and that behaves like an unstable escapee from a mental institution you do n't have to have a phd in psychology to see that amitabh 's character is seduced by sex and that the young woman has unresolved abandonment and daddy issues as for the recurring scene of vijay perched on the edge of a cliff contemplating suicide that 's about as close as he comes to having anything in common with jiah by behaving like a smitten teenage boy on a positive note the actors did a good job and cinematography good,0
some of the greatest and most loved horror movies have a wicked sense of humour but when a film comes along that is n't as original as the `` classics '' but just goes at it for laughs then a bunch of po-faced wanna-be critics completely slag it off this film made me laugh aloud several times this is testament to the way this film was approached and it shows the two main leads look natural and believable together and this really helps this film you root for them the whole way and laugh along with them everyone has friends like both of these guys another highlight for me was the monster truck it 's awesome intimidating and really well shot taking inspiration completely stealing from loads of films the most obvious being duel jeepers creepers and probably in reference to the jack black alike co-star orange county but really you can pick any road trip gone wrong movie and find a reference here but so what it 's not trying to win any oscars just give the viewer a good dose of frights and laughs and on that score it 's a 10 obviously it 's not getting a 10 i give real sensible reviews and scores unlike 99 of the people on imdb there is no-way this movie can get a zero like so many lazy idiots give to too many films and as fun as it was it ai n't getting a 10 either it 's just a good fun movie for anyone with a sense of humour and a liking for scares you really ca n't get anymore simple than that,0
i viewed the first two nights before coming to imdb looking for some actor info i saw the 9+ rating which surprised me since i was not that impressed by what i 'd seen as reference i happen to believe lonesome dove was the best tv western ever i grew up next to the mgm back lots in culver city in the 50s and have a certain sense of reverence about the western genre so i saw the glowing first review and decided to read `` more '' there i found several reviews with 1 or 2 stars that summed up my feelings well about the lack of character development poor editing feeling that it was shot on the universal back lot mgm 's is long gone and overall impression that it was not going to come close to changing my feelings about ld my impression is that the overwhelming vote of those who chose to write was `` less than a 4.0 '' this got me to wondering about the process that yields a 9+ rating if the people giving the 10s and 9s do not take the time to justify their vote is the ballot box being stuffed by people with a monetary motivation i have long used imdb as one tool to screen movies and thought it the best available now i am not so sure,0
if you have n't watched the movie yet but you do like comedy go out and buy or at least rent it the fact it won the animation oscar is not a coincidence i have n't watched many other wallace gromit movies in fact i think i only watched one other but the humor is very distinctive ... and some would also say very british in a good way of course the story will only be an excuse for all the jokes to come but although it 's not the most elaborate one it still works by the way my niece did guess see one of the big surprises coming i did n't kudos to her o i do think that after you watch this one you 'll go out and seek the other w g movies that are out there have fun,1
okay i can sit through almost any movie and i tend to get a real kick out of sci fi originals but there was a major flaw in this movie that made me have to turn it off half an hour into it having served in the us army there are certain expectations in a movie including the military at least some semblance of attention to proper military rank uniform and terminology is necessary if you expect a viewer to actually enjoy the experience `` bats human harvest '' had characters wearing rank that was facing the wrong direction on the lapel and later in the movie the time was listed as 11:00 hours but it was full dark outside even if the script was perfectly done and the dialogue spectacular and the acting oscar-worthy if the people making the movie do n't care enough about the movie to even bother to look up the proper way to display military time why should anybody bother to attempt to watch it,0
where the heck is andreas trond fausa aurvaag exactly heaven hell a parallel universe when the bothersome man steps off the subway platform and meets an onrushing train his next conscious moment occurs on a bus riding solo the newest arrival in a dead netherworld where all the suicides go dressed as he was at the time of his sudden departure from the corporeal biosphere andreas is greeted by an official man who processes and transports the bothersome man from the barren flatlands to a city if the eyeballs work is a dead ringer for the sort of urban landscapes that he once inhabited if memory serves him right andreas retains the look of a sleepwalker in a trance a man estranged from people and objects struggling to find his bearings at home or rather his assigned apartment or at work where the bothersome man is randomly designated as an accountant for an independent contractor havard johannes joner his boss tells him `` you 'll get used to it '' which covers more than just crunching numbers we suspect in this world same as the old world if life is meaningless like french existentialist philosopher jean-paul satre said the same can be said for death as well the subculture of office life might be heaven for one man but it looks like hell to us under the context that `` den brysomme mannen '' operates on to work in the afterlife in essence is to work for the rest of your life the social intercourse among andreas office mates may pass as normal in the physical world but death is a variable that creates estrangement in the viewer as he/she now recognizes the drudgery of white-collar labor performed by white-collar laborers who kill the hours with their inconsequential small-talk and designated jobs they perform during the course of a day like automotons each and every day seem irrational in its self-evident absurdity to see daily life replicated in a speculative light `` den brysomme mannen '' makes normal human interaction look like deadpan comedy as quotidian life becomes a performance which transforms karl marx 's meaning of the word `` alienation '' because here the men and women in the office `` do '' identify with their labor like actors in a play who conspire to make their fictionalized selves appear real but the bothersome man never fully participates in the facade he 's always aware of the cracks from a wooden bench andreas witnesses the aftermath of a jumper who impales himself on an iron fence while people on their lunch breaks walk on by indifferent to his escaping intestines that create red splatters on the clean sidewalk andreas faces the same impassivity from his own co-workers after he purposely cuts off his own finger with the hope that he 'll feel the pain on a paper slicer he does n't it 's just another sensation in addition to being able to taste and smell that 's lost to the bothersome man this inability of being able to take solace in the simple pleasures amplifies the bothersome man 's need for love where simple pleasures compensated for his loneliness in the physical world at a dinner party hosted by his boss andreas meets anne britt petonella barker they hit it off he walks her home she invites him in they become a couple he moves in when they have sex however it 's good for neither andreas nor anne who seems to get more pleasure out of interior design love is an abstract concept another sensation that 's unattainable in this world but love matters to the bothersome man so he tries again with ingeborg birgette lagen a girl from work `` den brysomme mannen '' deconstructs love by presenting its foundation as a series of gestures that require performances from both the man and woman when ingeborg does n't elicit the same tender feelings for andreas after his hyper-romantic gesture of leaving anne britt for her this norwegian film reveals its secrets about the prosaic but odd city with an open-endedness that 's solvable and offer up multiple interpretations wounded by ingeborg 's apathy towards his avowal of love for her the bothersome man wanders into the same subway station stands at the same platform leers at the same couple aggressively making out and jumps this time he ca n't die how can you die when you 're already dead hit repeatedly by train after train andreas face turns into ground beef his body contorts in angles previously seen only seen in art when the bothersome man realizes that love and death are out of his grasp he seeks out the man from the club who was willing to say what goes unsaid in this city of the walking dead which is death not life has no meaning getting to the bottom of the mystery behind andreas whereabouts drives the narrative and to the filmmaker 's credit this enigma is satisfactorily addressed in a scene that recalls spike jonze 's `` being john malkovich '' when andreas crawls through a tunnel in order to cross over into another world like a newborn baby which resembles the portal to malkovich 's brain that craig schwartz charges people to crawl through andreas attempt to traverse the great divide presents a beguiling paradox since heaven and earth are literally separated by a wall this vulnerable boundary acts as a perfect encapsulation of the atheistic belief that `` heaven is a place on earth '' but at the same time heaven is proved by the reality of a hell the place that andreas is sent to after being banished from the city of his destination,1
i really like harrison ford so i eagerly rented this movie only to be disappointed minute after minute mr. ford seemed to be walking through very warm water looking for a place to urinate his co-star was very good and had the better lines the story intrigued me but the mistake big mistake as everyone is identified via driver 's license or passport before they board any american commercial aircraft left numerous plot questions in my mind i could have cared less about these people in fact the sub-plot of the internal affairs investigation was more interesting than the two lovers killed while flying first class to miami i am disappointed in the director sydney pollack who gave us the classic tootsie and other films this one is a waste of time and energy,0
i am sorry but this is the worst film i have ever seen in my life i can not believe that after making the first one in the series they were able to get a budget to make another not that the budget could have been much this is the least scary film i have ever watched and laughed all the way through to the end actually i ca n't believe we watched it to the end but i think it is because we could n't quite believe it,0
am i the only one to notice that the `` realism '' of the 19th century ship is erroneous actually it 's a 15th century right around 1620 if memory serves me because the `` realistic '' ship in the movie is the mayflower now as far as i know the mayflower never went to australia or even attempted a voyage to australia i do n't know who handled r d for this film but using the mayflower and hoping that no one will notice is a poor job indeed they even printed it on the cover art and the dvd i wonder how may other people noticed this little blunder not to mention that the movie itself was just plain awful i would have expected better from sam neill,0
it was only the second year of the academy but already they were voting politically jeanne eagels brilliant performance in this creaky early talkie had to make do with an oscar nom and the statuette went to the worst performance ever to win mary pickford 's in coquette the only existing print was a work print without music or final editing but wherever it 's shown eagels stuns and captivates with her beguiling powerful performance she is so convincing on the witness stand that while we know she is lying through her teeth we did after all see her kill the man we in the audience find ourselves like the jurors believing in her innocence before we suddenly catch ourselves that is great acting the film needs to be made available on video so that the world can enjoy this terrific performance again one silent of jeanne 's exists in archive print man woman and sin and her only other talkie jealousy is `` lost '' so this is the only document we have of her run to see it when it first came out of the archives to be shown in nyc in the early 70s the village voice printed a full page review worshipping the eagels performance,0
i love everything about family guy my favourite characters in family are brian and stewie and i like the episodes when it mainly features them such as `` road to rhode island '' season 2 as they interact very well the comments they make just have me in stitches peter 's behaviour is also very funny as some of the things he does `` are just so brilliant they 're retarded '' the voice acting is excellent especially seth macfarlane as he provides the voices for half of the griffin family as well as their perverted neighbour glenn quagmire and how he manages this range particularly with singing i just do n't know he deserves his two emmy 's for providing the voice of evil baby genius stewie adam west also steals the show with his funny and completely insane regular character the mayor of quahog what i like about chris voiced by seth green is the things he says show that he takes after his father when it comes to intelligence and common sense the only thing i have found annoying is that in the uk fox has decided to change the seasons to increase dvd sales which in no way reflect the programme itself but rather the marketing if you enjoy family guy then i would thoroughly recommend seth macfarlane 's other project american dad which uses a different style of humour but is still extremely hilarious,1
missed it at the cinema but was always slightly compelled found it in the throw-out bin at my local video shop for a measly two bucks will i now give it away to anyone who wants it probably no purposeful plot one dimensional characters plastic world ripped off from many far better films no decent dialogue to speak of you know that empty feeling when you come down off ecstasy its that feeling right here sad thing is the australia i know is heading in this direction minus the melodrama and simple answers interesting only to see the older aussie actors who had to act back in their day to get by vs the newer aussie actors who have to look good to get by like some horribly garish narrative introduction to a film clip that never actually starts ... poor kylie started her career as an actress as well ...,0
miles o'keefe stars as ator a loin-clothed hero who resembles a chippendale 's dancer the conan-wannabe must do battle with an evil guy in a cher wig and protect the earth from the geometric nucleus a sort of primitive atomic bomb watch closely for visible sunglasses and tire-tracks mystery science theater 3000 made fun of it under the title cave dwellers,0
this 1950 's howler is so bad it 's unintentionally funny tom conway portrays dr. gerard a scientist who is turning natives into a monster using voodoo his poor wife played by mary ellen kay is being held captive by her wacko hubby who has no time for her but threatens to kill her if she leaves him along comes marla english as a greedy murderess who has already killed a man to find treasure in the jungle her idiot boyfriend portrayed by lance fuller is along on the safari they hire `` touch '' connors later renamed mike connors of mannix fame as a guide english is a terrible actress but hey no one else in the cast were turning in academy award winning performances either `` touch '' i 'm sorry i ca n't even type the name without cracking up i mean what the ... gave the only half way decent performance of the bunch and that 's saying a lot the monster is only seen briefly and the ending is predictable to say the least i would say this movie falls into the `` it 's so bad it 's almost good '' category of movies it 's good on a rainy night when nothing else is on the tube,0
this is probably the only movie i have ever not been able to make it all the way through not only was it annoying and boring but the low production values made it hard to make out the action and in some cases the dialogue avoid this one like the plague,0
this is a disaster-movie in both meanings of the word every character every role every conversation every twist everything in this movie stinks big time it 's a shame to see dennis hopper 's talent wasted in this dreadful movie i can give you 100 's of examples but see for yourself or rather do n't,0
i have seen this movie since i was a little girl and being from new york and remembering how people lived back then brought back a lot of good memories this movie is not just about wanting a fairy tale ending but understanding the struggles of becoming a better person woman and provider claudine attempted to be it was about the welfare system putting women in a binding situation it was about the injustice of a system that invaded and put demands on a family to stay afloat diane carroll was nominated for an oscar for this role and it was well deserved if you want to experience a strong family with conflicting but wonderful bonding moments enjoy claudine your goal as a viewer is to keep an open mind and understand the overall frustration,1
there are frames in this film that could be renoir paintings with vivid colors against muted backgrounds the humorous combination of sexual honesty and innocence is refreshing in this fifties film and makes palatable the old story line of the ingenue that becomes a star the can-can number at the end seems realistic and exciting but not over the top as in an american dance sequence,1
i 'm not a big tv person ... but when i saw the premier episode of greek i could n't wait until next week i do n't miss the show for nothing thank god for dvr lol i 'm in love with cappie ... he acts like a bad boy but he is so sweet ... everybody has their own character so we have pretty much all types of people you could still throw in a hispanic and a chubby persons i did n't go to school in usa so i never liked the idea of frat houses and stuff like that so when my husband told me about the show i did n't pay attention until he asked me to watch it and since i did n't have noting better to do i agreed i laughed so hard the first night that i just needed to keep watching it so .. i 'm with the other people that voted for this show to continue on i will hope for a second third and who knows how many more episodes its a really good show very funny and entertaining,1
the truth and reconciliation process in south africa is a vital and probably unique human experiment this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process almost every country has some part of its own history which is still a source of continuing hatred and bitterness we all need to understand ways of dealing with the past what 's happening in south africa should guide us all i found it credible moving and at times upsetting there were no outstanding acting performances but this added to the strength of the narrative once again the bbc has been instrumental in taking a complex topic and turning out a top class movie,1
while in one country spain luis bunuel and salvador dali combined forces to create the benchmark of short-subject cinematic surrealism un chien andalou walt disney and his collaborator ub iwerks in america worked on steamboat willie the most prominent of the early synchronized sound cartoons it was revealed that this was not the first contrary to other reports it 's also one of the more successfully simplistic and funny of the mickey mouse shorts still in a silent-film way- the only sounds are little irks and bleeps from the mickey and the animals it also goes by fairly quickly for its less-than-ten minute run but in these minutes one gets the immediate sense of how much fun disney has with his characters and how the newfound use of sound changes how his creation uses the animals as musical tools there 's no story to speak of just random things that happens and occurs because of mickey err steamboat willie on this boat on a river and like the better mickey mouse shorts his lack of speaking acts as an advantage it 's a must-see if you have n't seen it as a kid but if you have it might still be worth another look,1
i saw the trailer and read some reviews and i had low expectations for this movie i was pleasantly surprised while the plot is a little off-beat everybody in the making of this movie pulled off a pleasant flick good for many a laugh the writing and jokes are far more literate than i have come to expect better yet they are delivered with aplomb by unknown actors doing a good job all of them the main reasons i wanted to see this movie were justin long and lewis black long is from `` ed '' and the new apple computer ads he was just coming into his own as an actor in `` ed '' and he was excellent here he 's a natural in front of the camera lewis black is a social commentator who pulls no punches he 's on `` the daily show '' on comedy central about once every two weeks but he really shines in hbo 's `` red white and screwed '' i regularly catch him on xm radio 's uncensored comedy channel give black an idea and let him improvise whether his rants and lines here are scripted or improvised are no matter he 's priceless delivering his thoughts on middle class angst one thing about black 's delivery his hand gestures are not those of a comedian it just seems like he 's having a conversation with you and i think that makes him unconsciously more effective,1
in 1970 feminists invaded the 'miss world beauty contest in london and brought the occasion to a halt by pelting the stage with flour and eggs why because rightly or wrongly they felt the event to be demeaning and degrading to women i offer no criticism of their actions its a free world we live in what i want to know is why do n't their modern-day equivalents invade the studios where shows such as this are made and do likewise 'sex the city is all about four self-absorbed women from new york carrie is a slave to fashion who turns into a pussycat when a man so much as claps eyes on her charlotte yearns to find the perfect man they do n't exist love so she can use sex to ensnare the poor devil lawyer miranda scares men away by wittering nonsense like 'out of touch with my emotions and lastly we have samantha the living embodiment of the old martini ad 'anytime anyplace anywhere feminists hold up these characters particularly samantha as a shining example of modern-day womanhood well if shouting rude words in busy restaurants is progress i think the feminists should take a long hard look at themselves and what they 're supposed to represent had 'sex the city been the creation of a man it would have been pulled from the airwaves for being sexist instead like 'charlie 's angels before it it has conned supposedly intelligent women into thinking it has acted as a positive force for good there 's something very clinical and cold-blooded about the show 'the benny hill show was sexist too but at least it was funny,0

spoilers this movie was rented as a joke and what a joke it was the film is based on a dog catcher who is looking for el chupacabra the dog catchers outfit is so ridiculous it looks like he sewed the patch on his hat and for some reason he shows of his `` muscles '' by rolling up his sleeves throughout the movie mostly at night you can see how bad the lighting was they are in a car which is brightly lit and they are driving in pitch black often you can see the camera man 's shadow on the ground the costumes are terrible the lighting is terrible and the acting is terrible this is a good movie for a laugh ... maybe,0
sure it has its pretentious moments it plays like art-house live-action fantasia but it also has moments of deep beauty and humor omnibus films are always a problem but i have always had a keen interest in them i will now rate the segments individually nicolas roeg `` un ballo in maschera '' this segment may very well spoil the film for some people because it is absolutely the worst of the whole bunch it is difficult to follow mostly because it tries to adhere to a clear plot a hackneyed one at that the photography is unaccomplished the best thing about it is the bit of lesbian homoerotica that it never does enough with this segment made me very nervous about continuing 2/10 charles sturridge `` la virgine degli angeli '' an unclear segment but it hardly matters the film has the best cinematography of the bunch mainly because it is in a stunning black and white the segment is dreamlike and beautiful 7/10 jean-luc godard `` armide '' i chose to brave this much-maligned film for the godard and altman segments with godard i was much more impressed than i thought i would be i ca n't claim to have seen all that many of his films since he made so many that almost no one has seen but judging from what i have seen this may be his best work since the 60s it is the funniest segment in this film and the most artistically accomplished bravo jean-luc 9/10 julien temple `` rigoletto '' a very funny segment it is also quite predictable still this story about a husband and wife who are cheating on each other at the same resort is wonderfully filmed with long complex tracking shots that depend on precisely timed choreography from the actors it also has a great self-referencing joke about omnibus films themselves the final scene is very weak 7/10 bruce beresford `` die tote stadt '' this short segment involves too lovers in i think venice it is pretty with some nice shots of doves flying about the city it is slight but nice 7/10 robert altman `` les boréades '' not one of the better segments unfortunately this is more of a music video than a concept short film it involves the occupants of an insane asylum attending a theatrical performance the music and images work well together so at least i can give it credit for being a good music video 7/10 franc roddam `` liebestod '' somewhat unfortunate for beresford 's segment this segment is very similar to it as you might assume from my phrasing this one struck me much more it is about a young man and his girl going to las vegas on a fatalistic voyage 8/10 ken russell `` nessun dorma '' maybe the most visually striking segment it plays in a fantasy world more than in reality it is a beautiful tale of a fallen angel 8/10 derek jarman `` depuis le jour '' i have heard a lot about jarman and this is the first piece of filmmaking i have seen from him hopefully i 'll see more in the future this one is also music-videoish but it is better than altman 's segement it mainly concerns an old woman remembering her younger days the editing and the use of different film stocks to represent both time and emotion are very beautiful 8/10 bill bryden `` i pagliacci '' the sad clown possibly one of the most famous arias particularly memorable from an episode of seinfeld this serves as the material separating each segement and the finale it is simple and effective 7/10 overall i give it a solid 7/10 it is n't anywhere near as bad as you 've heard,1
sorry this movie was a bad made for tv movie are the rest of you on drugs when you watched it i thought the hair make-up and characters were poor 2 dimensional types the story is doubtful especially since all of the main characters are dead or nearly dead i think it 's not well acted either ... what was up with that hair on the main guy in the turtles it looked glued on badly and the sideburns looked like they were going to fall off at any moment it did n't feel like anything new was revealed in the story of the band and how the members met other bands and people i laughed all the way through it frank zappa looked stupid so did mama cass and so did the beatles they were made out to look stupid and ridiculous also the other band people like jim morrison donovan also took a big hit at looking stupid too kind of terrible if this is how you remember these people it 's a poor history lesson on music it 's fictional the way it was made,0
like anyone else who bought this i was duped by the `` 20 pieces of extreme gore '' and `` banned in 20 countries '' or whatever it says in the box i have to admit i am a huge gore fan and i am always amazed when films can lay it on thick and look convincing doing it tom savini rick baker and greg cannom are some of the best in the business the revolutionized make-up effects in the 80 's today you do n't need them as everything is done on computer but computers can not compare to the visual wizardry that these three men could conjure up but i digress watching fantastically gory films like fulci 's gates to hell or even savini 's crowning achievement friday the 13th the final chapter you can appreciate all that goes into making a terrifically gory film you ca n't tell the difference between reality and magic i ca n't imagine another reason why anyone would see cannibal ferox but the gore that is ostensibly omnipotent in this film if that is the reason you seek this film then you are wasting your money as many other reviewers in here have noted most of the gore is an aftermath you do n't see the torture or the bloodshed as it happens you see whatever it looks like afterwords the gore well it 's here but not as much as one would hope or expect a man does get castrated and a women does get hanged by her breasts but other then those two scenes and one involving a scalping there is nothing really much else to this film the scenes of gore even in these three mentioned are still pretty tame in comparison to what you were hoping for maybe it 's just me and my sick and twisted experience in the horror and gore genre but i was expecting a bit more call me sick or twisted but is n't that the only reason people are watching this film in the first place i honestly found myself bored in a lot of places cannibal ferox is just another film that tries to capitalize on a craze of a superior film while cannibal holocaust is not exactly a great film it is much better than this tripe if you go out of your way to buy this for 20.00 you will feel cheated 3/10,0
this was supposed to be set in the `` bible belt '' of northern ireland well as someone who grew up there and was a child in the era depicted in the film it just did n't ring true the accents were all over the place anything but county antrim/derry the church did n't resemble any i have ever seen `` the church of god '' is a pentecostal denomination but the one in the film was certainly not pentecostal the elderly minister at the beginning was dressed in the robes of the church of ireland anglican and no c.of i. would call itself `` the church of god '' the minister was often addressed as `` reverend '' they may do that in some parts of the world but i never heard it when i lived in that area ministers were addressed as `` mr ...... '' this film was very badly researched and cast fairly typical of irish cinema annoying a film can have a great plot but if it does n't look authentic it is rubbish,0
as you know `` the greatest game ever played '' is about golf i used to snicker at the over-dramatic title but through great visual display credited to director bill paxton better known for his acting in twister and hilarious supporting roles in aliens and true lies we find out that this has much more meaning than a game though the movie is about golf it seems as though the sport is just the framework for what is really going on what is really going on is a story of individuals being told they ca n't fulfill their dreams be it age or social status a conflict between a son 's wishes and a father 's demands an english golf legend looking to bring the title home with the country breathing down his neck shia labeouf even stevens plays francis ouimet a caddy with a god-given talent who was never permitted to play golf in the first place despite the resentment of the upper class `` gentlemen '' it was undeniable that francis had a gift what posed a greater threat was the discouragement of his father played by elias koteas sugartime teenage mutant ninja turtles who felt that playing a mere game will never improve their poor living conditions with the continued support of his mother francis eventually comes face to face with his idol the golf legend harry vardon stephen dillane more impressive than the game itself was the movie 's cinematic achievement this proved that storytelling is successful through pure cinema the entire movie could 've been told without dialog there are scenes in the movie that build strong suspense and powerful emotion with only pictures in one particular scene francis ouimet swings and the entire crowd turn their heads to watch the ball fly into the distance all but the face of harry vardon looking intensely at ouimet without a flinch the ways in which the golfers visualize the course offer more aesthetic enjoyment a pleasant supporting cast completes the whole peyton list plays the love interest and looks worth playing for and josh flitter plays a lovable caddy that keeps ouimet focused as the pressure bogs him down golf fan or not you 'll appreciate the film for its beauty and its reminder that cinema can be a great medium to tell any story,1
i 've seen this movie more than once it is n't the greatest scifi flick i 've every seen but it is not a bad movie the acting is good and the characters are more `` real '' than most in low budget sci fi at least it is n't full of dumb bimbos like so many other low budget scifi i especially like elizabeth pena she is a good actress and she does worried single mother as well as any and better than some do n't let the nay sayers run you off see it for yourself and judge it for yourself,1
a scarily real drama there is n't another drama out there that has scared the crap out of me like this has the characters are not your typical islamic terrorist you have a blonde haired blue eyed guy who is as dumb as he looks he is a converted muslim a well respected business man who pretends to be jewish and a frenchman who has converted to islam but has clearly taken the word of the koran to a whole new level the hero of the plot is darwyn who is an undercover fbi agent who has infiltrated the terrorist cell and has to do all sorts of god awful things to prevent himself from being detected the first episode is a small taste of what 's to follow although it is about islamic terrorists the drama has a unique way of pointing out that not all muslims are extremists which is comforting to those concerned with racism considering half the terrorist cell are islam converts it makes you think that maybe they are the ones to be afraid of the most chilling drama i 've ever seen the reason its so chilling is cause you never know who your friends your husband or your neighbours really are terrorists can be anyone anywhere anytime,1
as a nice anecdote to one of the above comments in was in mumbai about two weeks before the release of this movie i was approached -being white- to dub some of the lines of this movie in a recording studio while i speak german as well i was kindly asked to do all dubbing scenes in english otherwise it would be too confusing for the indian audience ... so therefore all germans in this movie actually speak english funny enough i did multiple characters so if you would want to actually spoil some time by watching the movie again listen carefully all non-indian characters are only done by 4 voices,0
`` purgatory flats '' shown on cable recently is a small movie that packs a lot harris done directs with style the screen play by mr. done and diane fine makes a good thriller if you have n't seen the film perhaps you would like to stop reading the film is the story about a young l.a. doctor that made a mistake and lives to pay for it upon being released from prison he wants to hide in a small town where he feels he will be forgotten bad choice what thomas reed finds in purgatory flats is hell in the desert right after landing a job as a bar tender thomas meets a pretty young woman sunny who clearly is someone to stay away from the young doctor is called to help as sunny 's boyfriend randy is gunned down by a drug dealer we get to know randy 's family his uncle dean appears to be ok but his brother owen is a loose cannon every one in the household is connected in more ways than one to the nubile sunny the performances are fine vincent ventresca is thomas the man who should have gone to his l.a. practice instead of making a detour to the small town alexandra holden is sunny a young woman with a tremendous ambition to escape her surroundings kevin alejandro gregg henry brian austin play the men in the mecklin family well nicholas turturro makes also a good contribution as the drug dealer the film shows a director with promise who will go far judging from this tightly constructed film,1
excellent work all around especially by the actress who played the wife gerda claire price as well of course as david suchet i did really figure out whodunit but that is beside the point the ending which i wo n't divulge someone describes it on the board in answer to someone else 's question if you are interested i found really sad despite agatha christie 's reputation for writing cardboard characters i thought these really well-rounded by and large the pacing of the story was good and i enjoyed seeing sarah miles as lucy and edward hardwicke cedric 's son i believe in addition to being a well-known dr watson as her husband,1
most people attending this film will have no idea of the great novel by arthur miller that is the basis of it it 's a novel that should be read by more people to see how prejudice affects and alters peoples lives at the beginning lawrence newman is an ordinary man the eyeglasses his boss makes him get change everything he has worked for and his whole world collapses around him little by little there could n't have been an actor better suited to bring this intelligent performance to the screen than william h. macy not only is he a talented stage and screen actor but he projects honesty behind every character he plays he is an everyday man caught in his own insecurities his anxiety intensifies when he takes a stand and walks out of his job suddenly he has to confront the issues he has tried to avoid all his middle class existence in the brooklyn of the 40s is he jewish is he not the cinematography in this brilliant and atmospheric film directed with sure hand by neil slavin kept reminding me of some edward hopper 's paintings especially a sequence at the beginning of the film when newman steps outside a building and the night shot when he and his wife are being followed with long black shadows behind the couple menacing and anticipating the confrontation with the bullies laura dern david paymer and especially meat loaf who infuses incredible depth to the bully-next-door are excellent but they all pale in comparison with the stellar turn of william h. macy h must stand for honest .. if you have n't read the book i would sincerely recommend it because no one has written more truly and convincingly than arthur miller has,1
this is a typical college comedy and its very average the story is ok but not very entertaining its about a unlucky guy named reno who looses his job gets his car ripped off and then his uncle dies in a stripbar his got a girlfriend though a nice one btw anyway this uncle gives him his mansion in la and mercedes as heritage and soon reno and his girlfriend moves to la to this new house the problem is that they would need some roommates in order to pay the high rent for this house and so the film unfolds ... the movie starts ok and has a few funny jokes here and there but the suddenly the movie takes a turn straight down to hell ... the ending is bad really bad it destroys everything about the movie you will know what i 'm talking about when you see the movie ... 2/10,0
hands of the ripper aspect ratio 1.85:1 sound format mono an edwardian doctor eric porter uses newfangled freudian analysis on a young girl angharad rees who turns out to be the daughter of jack the ripper and just as deadly ... unlikely hammer horror in which a respectable society figure takes charge of a beautiful young waif without attracting so much as a whiff of scandal even when she takes to murdering all and sundry with a variety of lethal implements broken mirrors hat-pins etc. l.w davidson 's screenplay wanders aimlessly from one murder to another sacrificing the material 's inherent subtext porter 's obvious attraction to rees in favor of commercial melodrama and the tone remains subdued throughout some of the gore scenes are surprisingly vivid even for hammer and these were clipped from the original us release despite an r rating from the mpaa though the complete version is now available on home video porter and rees give excellent performances and the climax in st. paul 's cathedral is a definite highlight but the rest of the film is strangely hollow and unaffecting directed by peter sasdy,0
i´ve been able to see this great movie at the fantasyfilmfest in berlin and when i went out of the cinema i felt like being drugged down g i´ve really seen lots of movies and there are just a few i´d call perfect like fight club or koyaanisqatsi subconscious cruelty is now one of them half of the people watching it in berlin went out of the room and i can understand this absolutely because it can be a real shock for someone living in his/her perfect world day by day dreaming his/her dreams not thinking bout the horror on our planet-in our life i don´t think i have to describe the story of the film for you because of the people having already written on this page it´s a movie that shows everything and more gets 10 points from 10 it´d be cool if you people who have also seen it loving it would write me an e-mail so far i haven´t met anyone as impressed and pleased by it as i am finally sorry for my bad english-i´m not a studied person und das ist auch gut so,1
i have watched thousands of movies in my life and i believe this movie is the most `` perfect '' movie that has ever been made by perfect i mean the storytelling the plot the acting the staging the camera work etc this is a lay opinion i have no background in film production a lot of movies have perfect scenes such as the bartender filing a report with the police officer in the movie fargo indeed that scene could play well as a short in the dead every scene is done to perfection making the entire movie perfect perhaps john huston sold his soul to the devil to make such a movie hopefully daniel webster has gotten him out of the contract,1
if you 're looking for a not-so-serious mob movie with a female as the lead you 're in the right place pfieffer has acted much better than this you can see she has matured beyond this picture when i first picked this movie up i expected pfeiffer was poorly miscast however she plays her mob wife role to the hilt not a bad performance from baldwin either if you do n't pay attention to the hair you might enjoy this movie but do n't take it too seriously ...,1
in an earlier comment i mentioned how much i enjoyed this film better second time around i do n't resile from that opinion strangely i ca n't find anyone else who did like it my mother was going to see it but several friends told her `` no way '' my sister and her family saw it and half the theatre walked out part-way through my wife 's suggestion is that australians see the characters as just normal everyday americans and therefore it 's not funny but hey most americans think all australians are like crocodile dundee so it 's nice to have the boot on the other foot for a change,1
garbo 's first spoken words in this 1930 film electrified audiences and became part of hollywood legend garbo had become a star in her first american film the torrent in 1926. and audiences waited til this film to see if garbo could make the transition to talkies she did and while pola negri vilma banky and renee adoree fell by the wayside because of their accents garbo sailed on for another decade despite the staginess of this film garbo is really excellent especially in the opening scene with the equally great marie dressler as marthy the two great stars trade dirty looks and sharp words as they size each other up while they have a few drinks and set the tone for the remainder of the film garbo was 25 dressler was 60. charles bickford is ok as matt and george f. marion is good as old chris marion originated this role on broadway in 1922 and also played it in the 1923 silent version with blanche sweet this eugene o'neill play is a true classic yet oddly was never filmed again anna christie ranks as one of garbo 's greatest performances and despite the staginess of the film and the grimness of the story she is truly a marvel see this one for garbo and dressler,1
the worst part about this film is that it did not have to be so terrible they had a nice budget though so do many films they made it look slick and pretty and best of all they had the 21st century lesbian-savvy audiences who would embrace a lesbian positive film ... and yet the writer and director went out of their way to lift every single redone film bit about lesbian torment and confusion at boarding schools you know the place all lesbian love lives and dies this is a theme that has been done again and again and again in film but something that viewers-if one uses this voting forum as a clue- can not seem to get enough of every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through the lead characters say it all the crazy abandoned genius rebel lesbian tough girl well they took a super pretty femme like piper perabo and tried to rough her up but it did n't stick much seduces pretty rich girl who is destined to betray her watching them every step of the way is character 3 a dopey well-meaning wide-eyed good girl observer i say 'every step because she shares her every thought with the audience via the stiffest most inane monologues her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well ... talk `` hearing them make love with their noises was um you know like well ... okay '' she says about her 2 wanton roommates who roll around in the bed next to her later she asks graham greene- the accomplished native american actor who is completely wasted in a roll as a gardener `` is it wrong to care what people think '' sorry but is she a teenager or is she age 7 granted piper perabo as polly the tortured dyke others do an okay job for the horrible lines they are forced to utter perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera she would do well in a decent project so this is in no way a criticism of the acting but this story is shameless in perpetuating every single stereotype about lesbians all rolled into one character they could n't stop with her polly being an angry crazy-passionate secret genius who finished math problems for the speechless teacher oh but that 's after she argues with the teacher who dares accuse her of `` gabbing '' `` that 's a word they males use against us women '' she says stomping out of the classroom is this all the writer could come up with or maybe we should ask why stop there poole and co. went on and made polly a poetic dark child who communicates with wild hawks by screaming their name in the woods cue the slow motion sci-fi xena atmosphere then we have her writing to her birth mother ... most lesbians are love-starved orphans in case you were in the dark then we have two teachers one uptight one a zany type with loose neck ties who hover around all of the action the school looks awfully big for just 2 teachers ... and give dark child/ seductress/bird girl tense looks hmmmm i wonder if something well you know ... um funny is happening between these two teachers there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done heartbreak happens but surely the writer and director know that lesbians exist in much more sophisticated times than this schlock i can not reveal the ending out of respect to those who force themselves to sit through til the end but if you are not laughing i can only guess you are crying and not for the right reason and i do n't mean the wimpy make out scenes,0
i did n't really care for this had they gotten rid of the comedy/slapstick and focused on the dramatic/philosophical aspects of the script this might have been worthwhile the more the film went on the less i liked the protagonist/mailman he does have interesting things to say but he 's also a hypocritical insecure jerk 3/10,0
universal studios the name conjures up so many memories to horror fans of beautiful matte paintings ... er ... landscapes fog-enshrouded countrysides full moons howling wolves taverns and torch wielding mobs yet it is quite strange looking back on those films how little the era which produced the true classics lasted the '30 's had it 's masterpieces but those were mostly from the same directors and many of their films are mostly of historical interest today the '40 's produced more mindlessly fun matinée films than it did high art and most fans agree that the classic era of the gothic horror films ended in 1945 with 'house of dracula bumped around with the abbott costello comedies and was officially dead by the 50 's and the coming of the atomic age so it 's strange that perhaps one of universal 's finest gothics was made in the '50s that alone makes the film an oddity since costume dramas were on their way out everywhere it may not be comparable to the all time classics like the james whale films and 'the wolfman but damn does it condense all the fun elements of those films into one delicious treat get ready for nothing but pure entertainment since various social mores had changed the film also indulges in violence that would not have been allowed in earlier eras there 's no blood but we see characters shot and stabbed directly and there 's even a burning torch to the face the film may not really be a horror film but it sure has the atmosphere look and feel of one it begins in the dead of night with howling winds and wolves as two men seal the tombs of two apparently dead young lovers but wait one of them is not dead but he ca n't move he 's trapped but talking silently in his own mind unable to communicate what is his story now that is how you start a horror film .... english businessman sir ronald burton richard greene giving one of his best performances sets out under the alias of richard beckett to investigate the disappearance of two friends of his who disappeared at the castle of one-eyed austrian count von bruno did sacha baron cohen see this it seems many years ago von bruno posed as a god to the natives in africa to steal ivory he was exposed by burton 's men and the natives disfigured him now he is lusting for revenge the film has all the clichés a jonathan harker-style ride to the castle an inn full of wary villagers death traps and a hulking manservant lon chaney jr. the torture chamber scenes are genuinely suspenseful including a panel in the floor that activates a dungeon door which makes for an ingenious getaway scene later on a hunting expedition involving an imported panther and even an alligator pit and then there 's the romeo juliet-style fake death that leads to the film 's prologue .... the plot is cliché and the world-view is black and white but it 's still incredibly entertaining with director nathan juran making every scene pile on the atmosphere and seem fresh and new there are several plot-holes too why does ronald attempt to leave the castle so early and he never does solve the mystery of what happened to his friends even though it 's obvious but he does n't know that when he gives up and he seemed so sure earlier weird all of the actors are great despite being a rude upperclassman richard greene makes burton one of the most likable protagonists i 've ever seen in a horror film rita corday is excellent as the count 's 'peasant wife who becomes burton 's love interest she may have the stereotypical 'falling in love with just a glance problem of all film heroines of this era but her portrayal of a long-suffering woman in a loveless marriage to a sadistic monster is very convincing she also shows a suspicion and wit few film heroines of this era do even seeing a forced attempt by burton to quiet her and to paw at her necklace although it is simply to analyze it as it has an important clue as a rape attempt yet she never seems nasty in her paranoia the audience sympathizes with her even though he fails to make von bruno seem truly foreign and otherworldly he is a villain in a horror film after all stephen mcnally gives a truly chilling performance as the sadistic nobleman when he reveals his burnt eye and laughs maniacally it is truly scary lon chaney jr. is also great as his mute henchman gargon but the best performance is undeniably by boris karloff as the mysterious physician dr. meissen he has little screen time at first but steals every scene he is in it is a performance that is both creepy sad mysterious and ultimately heroic as he leers evilly as he applies leeches to one of bruno 's henchman spies on our hero and speaks in that famous 'you know i 'm up to no good voice only karloff could make you wonder whether if he is a hero or villain always skulking about and although he does function as the main agent of our hero 's escape he still shows human frailties such as greed and fearfulness for his own life even cold-bloodedly poisoning a man for burton 's benefit before he even gets burton to agree his plan to help our hero heroine escape also puts them directly in the clutches of von bruno as he arranges an amazingly sadistic if unbelievably flawed death for them that had to have inspired similar scenes in corman 's poe series he may not have much screen time but this is easily one of boris 's best performances while the ending may seem abrupt and anti-climatic for some half the fun is getting there and there 's much excitement to be had kick back and relive the days when heroes were heroes and villains were villains it 's no masterpiece but it 's escapist fun at it 's best,1
well it certainly stunned me i can not believe that someone made another australian film that 's even more boring than somersault the story is implausible the characters with the exception of friels and mailman 's characters are unlikeable and wooden tom long possesses a vast array of facial expressions happy and not happy and the `` sex scenes '' which could have been very confronting and disturbingly erotic would have been at home in a low-budget porno flick this is the first movie i have seen in 30 years of cinema-going that has had me on the edge of my seat .... ready to get up and leave the best thing about this movie is the promotional poster,0
stan laurel and oliver hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history and deservedly so so i am happy to see any of their films ollie is recovering from a broken leg in hospital and with nothing else to do stan decides to visit him and take him some boiled eggs and nuts instead of candy chaos begins with stan curiously pulling ollie 's leg cast string and manages to push the doctor billy gilbert out the window clinging on to it getting ollie strung up to the ceiling when the situation calms down stan gets ollie 's clothes as the doctor wants them both to leave and he also manages to sit on a syringe accidentally left by the nurse filled with a sleeping drug which comes into effect while he is driving which you can tell is done with a car in front of a large screen filled with some likable slapstick and not too bad although repetitive and a little predictable classic comedy it is n't great but it 's a black and white film worth looking at stan laurel and oliver hardy were number 7 on the comedians comedian okay,0
lets get one thing out of the way i am a huge bruce campbell fan i have the evil dead series have the action figures and have seen bubba ho-tep i am a fan of cheesy laughable horror flicks and know how to appreciate the whole `` it 's so bad it 's good '' deal i wish i could say the same about this movie i watched this movie with high expectations i wanted it to be good campy something from the bc we have all come to know and love it started out promising enough but after the first 20 minutes i resided to watching the rest of this sorry excuse of a movie as if i had just been shot with tranquilizer darts the idea itself is n't a bad one two men do n't get along both killed by the same psycho woman half of one man 's brain is transplanted into the other 's head they argue disagree and the comedy ensues what killed me is how extremely unorganized and boring it was it had potential even as a camp flick to be so much better than it was the plot was boring even bruce 's zany physical slap stick could n't make it work word 's can not even properly express the ridiculous robot that bruce 's wife 's brain ends up getting put into easily the worst looking robot i have ever seen anywhere even for a b movie the whole idea is dumb what the hell was going through bruce 's mind when he made this steaming pile is beyond me why ted raimi did n't go running to his big brother asking him to slap some sense into bruce and not to mention some lessons about making an enjoyable movie on a budget is beyond me shame on you bruce,0
another 'good overcoming evil story but with a difference this includes learning self-discipline when julie goes with her teacher to a zen monastery she learns about herself she also hones her karate skills when the zen monks visit the city some awkward and comical moments ensue not uproarious but entertaining nonetheless next karate kid has much to say about looking within and improving what is there -- as well as using what you have,1
pretty pretty actresses and actors pretty bad script pretty frequent `` let 's strip to our undies '' scenes pretty fair f/x pretty jarring location decisions the college dorm room looks like a high-end hotel room probably because it was shot at a hotel pretty bland storyline pretty awful dialog pretty locations pretty annoying editing unless you like the music video flash-cut style this one is n't a guilty pleasure this is more an embarrassing one if you must watch this pick a good dance/techno album and turn the sound off on the movie you 'll see the pretty people in their pretty black undies and probably follow the story just fine the cast may be able to act i doubt that anyone could look skilled given the lines/plot that they had to deal with,0
up front if you 're tired the first hour could be slow the set up of the story has a natural leisurely pace unhurried giving us time to appreciate the kind of everyday life and situations the main characters are in once you arrived at the climatic segment of the storyline the turn of events will keep you hooked how will things turn out what will happen to our precious fanda portrayed to utter quiet perfection by the veteran czech actor vlastimil brodský how will his wife wonderfully played by stella zázvorková treat him what happens to fanda 's dear friend ed played by stanislav zindulka a matching sidekick to brodský and jára the son with selfish hidden agenda blind to the kindness of his parents sigh vladimír michálek sensibly directed the film with sprinkles of humor preserving the insightful script by jirí hubac thanks to clear subtitling i was able to notice for every 'complaining phrase fanda 's wife utters there 's a hint of 'caringness showing/buried in between the lines and so did the judicious lady judge observed fanda is '76 going on 80 and the affection of their enduring endearing marriage manifests even in their bantering arguments his playfulness can be infectious this is 'growing old together 101 for at least the beyond fifties and lessons learned to sons and daughters not to take parents for granted one may need to rethink if assuming 'home for the aged is a means to an end so to speak the film is gently shouting to us to live life to the fullest while we can hint there 's joy in staying on and watch the end credits roll we 're fortunate to be able to see an occasional czech film the sverák `` kolya '' father son 's 2001 `` dark blue world '' was revealing with pathos it 's good to take it slow now and then and appreciate a foreign gem its subtitles scenery melodic score and an engaging human story with elegant performances `` autumn spring '' aka babí léto is available on dvd enjoy,1
this film gave me probably the most pleasant surprise of any i 've ever seen it was not a big-budget production and its premise middle-age amateur jazz musicians get an unexpected professional engagement at a catskills-like resort seems rather modest what 's not modest is the film 's success this is a little slice-of-life movie that is most entertaining throughout director frank d. gilroy also wrote the script and it 's full of interesting subplots and unexpected twists the actors are journeymen who do a solid job the biggest revelation to me was cleavon little he plays a professional musician who is hired to fill in for an ailing band member his attitude immediately clashes with the others while they see it as an opportunity for big fun and a once in a lifetime thing he sees it as his job and not a particularly interesting one this leads to conflict but when the group gets in trouble he steers them through little who died too young really showed me he was a fine actor with this film this movie is a true sleeper the kind that a film fan always hopes to discover i recommend it wholeheartedly,1
i love this film ... i 've seen it 1000 x on dvd and i cant say enough about it it has it all comedy awesome action and incredible stunts/fx samuel jackson steals the show here big time i dont think there isnt a moment that he 's in that he isnt funny `` everyone knows that when you make an assumption you make an ass out of you and umption '' the f/x are great the bridge/truck explosion is incredible although the sound isnt all that great when samuel drives out of the truck the sound is off a little i think and what he says is priceless for those of you who own it on dvd put the audio in french it 's halarious even emotional moments are great when the bad guy discovers that sam's/charlie 's daughter is his is great ... this is a great film that no action fan can do without ... i also reccomend cutthroat island ... aside from all the negative publicity it kicks,1
i watched this movie as a child and still enjoy viewing it every once in a while for the nostalgia factor when i was younger i loved the movie because of the entertaining storyline and interesting characters today i still love the characters additionally i think of the plot with higher regard because i now see the morals and symbolism rainbow brite is far from the worst film ever and though out-dated i 'm sure i will show it to my children in the future when i have children,1
all i can say is that i was expecting a wick movie and `` blurred '' surprised me on the positive way very nice teenager movie all this kinds of situations are normal on school life so all i can say is that all this reminded me my school times and sometimes it 's good to watch this kind of movies because entertain us and travel us back to those golden years when we were young as well lead us to think better in the way we must understand our children because in the past we were just like they want to be in the present time.try this movie and you will be very pleased.at the same time you will have the guarantee that your time have not been wasted,1
perhaps this movie was meant to be nothing but funny maybe it was meant to get teenage boys excited at all the nudity in it but what i got out of it was actually something that many people believe in and that is `` nice guys finish last `` there is a line in angel heart from lisa bonet 's character that says `` it takes a bad ass to make a girls heart beat faster. `` true most likely women always say that they want the flowers and the candy and politeness and whatever but at least at an early age they end up going for the good looking slimy disrespectful untamed guy the one they know they ca n't conform to their beliefs and that is part of the attraction after all what is exciting about a guy that is already the way you want him to be i believe this may have happened to boaz davidson and what he has to say in this film that is disguised with sex and nudity and parties and everything else that teens can relate to is that you will get your heart broken it happens to everyone and it will happen to you and that is a strong final statement in the film but having said all that the movie is fun it is funny and it shows the antics of highschoolers quite well this is a rare film that is sleezy enough to please the teenage crowd it caters to but also intelligent and poignant enough to show what it s like to get your heart broken no highschool film has ever done this better like i said i think the writers must have experienced a situation like this first hand maybe we all have this is an old film but if you ever come across it gathering dust on a shelf in your local video store one night pick it up you may be surprised it is a hell of a lot better than never been kissed,1
this movie gives us some wwii history along with some touching romance a little fantasy and meaningful emotion and beautiful scenery nicholas cage never fails us and here again does a great job and so do the other principle characters one key charater the physician/father played by john hurd delivers to his daughter one of the best definitions of love i 've ever heard some of the events are a bit too coincidental to be real but i excused that knowing that this is partly fairy tale and fantacy my wife and i really liked the film and it is nice to watch people taking the risks to love the enemy one man who left the theatre near us said to his wife `` now that 's the way to wage war '' i think you 'll see what he means when you watch the italian occupiers of this lovely greek island,1
without a doubt this is the worse comicbook movie every made period yes it 's worse then dolph lundgren 's 1989 punisher yup .. worse then the 1979 1991 captain america movies oh yeah it 's even worse then christopher reed scripted superman iv quest for peace movie sheeshh .. that movie was so bad that the guy who played nuclear man only starred in one other film and it was only on t.v =op this movie is `` d '' quality i had a chance to watch it on the scifi channel back in 1997. i had heard it was pretty bad but had nothing else to do that night so i figured i check it out what a waste of an hour and a half i would have been better off watching reruns of different strokes besides having the lamest special effects and worse acting i 've ever seen the whole script was just awful and not well directed at all thankfully a new fantastic four movie is being done and hopefully this version will do the heroes justice i was hoping for a new spawn movie in the future but it has yet to materialize do not rent this movie if you happen to see it being televised on cable check it out be warned though you 'll most like be flipping the channel after the first 15 mins,0
a pig-tailed linnea quigley drinks milk strips and kills her sister and her sister 's boyfriend after they have sex she goes to an asylum makes a best friend out of amy karen russell and the two blackmail their way out of a mental institution by sleeping with their psychologists one is played by `` carol burnett show '' regular lyle waggoner on the outside these two man-hating mafia princesses stop taking their medication and invite six slimeball ex-boyfriends over to their large country home for a party where they 're systematically slaughtered in very gory ways by a gloved leather-clad mystery killer the hideous david barton fx are so bloody but so unrealistic that they take on a sort-of surrealistic quality same goes for the movie the dialogue is so strange and stilted the film so ineptly paced and edited and the acting so other-worldly you 'll start to doubt your own sanity this film actually attempts to have a plot and three-dimensional characters but it 's all so poorly handled it 's almost like what would happen if ed wood did a rewrite of an ingmar bergman script and like any good bergman film this has a mature moral to abide by -- any good party needs a proper guy/girl `` ratio '' so there will be enough chicks to `` tickle your lizard '' see it for yourself ... or do n't linnea the only reason i was even interested in watching this to begin with is very amusing in this one has a lot more dialogue than usual and has several eye-popping nude scenes unfortunately she also completely disappears from the final third of this film and the movie suffers because of it score 3 out of 10,0
i 've never seen a bollywood film before but i caught the first ten minutes of this laughed myself silly and hit the r button on sky+ i 'm glad i did i hope i do n't insult anybody because basically the bf and i loved it but we could n't take it half as seriously as the actors did especially the obsessed one who i understand is a huge bollywood star because we 've seen him on the cover of lots of dvds since and i even saw a doll of him today in hamleys the bf keeps on about this bloke i am beginning to think he 's obsessed he keeps saying that it 's strange for the traditionally good looking one to be the anti-hero of a film but then we do like films that are n't your stock predictable hollywood fare it was completely over the top but really good fun if all bollywood films are like this then we 're watching more i have had that bloomin song in my head all week and i ca n't speak a word of hindi ps any recommendations would be appreciated,1
one of the most unfairly maligned programmes of all time 'terry june was also one of the most popular sitcoms of the '70 's and '80 's it started life as 'happy ever after but when eric merriman decided he did n't want to write any more it changed into this hence the dropping of 'aunt lucy and the fletcher 's becoming the medford 's yes it was cosy domestic middle-class stuff the plots ran the gamut of clichés from the boss coming to dinner the vicar organising a jumble sale and unwanted relatives coming to stay for the weekend it was certainly not 'dreadful lazy comedy as for it being 'not clever it was not meant to be it was funny and well performed and that was enough i too loved the 'alternative boom of the '80 's 'spitting image 'black adder 'the young ones etc but also enjoyed conventional stuff such as this if nothing else it provided alternative comedy with something to be an alternative to i found it sad though when the likes of ben elton took against both this and benny hill well family oriented comedy has all but vanished from our screens but where has it left us take a look at the latest t.v schedules all soaps and reality dross the few comedies left are aimed at teenagers meaning they are jam packed with swearing bodily function jokes and explicit sexual references and they are not remotely funny either the 'alternative comedy boom was good in many ways but had a dark side it made conventional sitcoms appear old fashioned drove away talented writers and performers such as spike milligan and ultimately led to such unspeakable drivel as 'little britain and 'tittybangbang heaven help us if it ai n't broke do n't fix it,1
it is fascinating how this title manages to slip by the average viewer as something new and groundbreaking quoting some of the comments murali k. thalluri must have thought by himself `` oh great elephant ... what a fantastic movie i 'll try hard to do exactly the same movie and see if anyone notices `` sadly enough he even failed with his outrageous idea the movie turns out a complete failure considering that it tries hard to catch the brilliance of gus van sants `` elephant '' it makes it look even more ridiculous a most embarrassing faux pas for a film director the movie starts off with the suicide of a student in the schools bathroom this scene already shows the awkward acting skills of each one involved in this scene you do n't buy a single word they say in carries on interrupted by short interview-styled bits of the kids who `` live on their marry lives '' with each bit rather distressing in its plain stupidity on the basis of each worthless monologue thalluri means to introduce the characters this way to give a kind of fast-as-junk-food insight look into their hearts ... and fails once again not five minutes later thalluri ultimately screams at the audience `` yes people i stole this movie and for some curious reason i am proud of it '' by taking gus van sants most unmistakable narrative style from `` elephant '' he shot scenes twice to let the viewer follow each character involved in a scene on his particular way and role in a school situation hm does n't this seem awfully familiar to me this certain level of very forgiving tolerance had been infringed right there to a point at which i could n't stand this dreadful movie any more shame on you murali k. thalluri i say i am especially surprised that `` 2:37 '' has reached the official selections in cannes as of 2006 whereas everyone must have certainly remembered `` elephant '' 2003 at the very same film festival just a few years ago so how in the name of the lord did this most disgraceful rip-off end up being shown there i find myself absolutely puzzled by this mistake directors like thalluri use the ignorance of audiences who are n't and can not completely be aware of every independent film out there as elephant has little to do with mainstream cinema although it is without a doubt a masterpiece few people notice that the story as told in `` 2:37 '' had been told before how that is possible at a film festival of such importance as attributed to cannes i can not say it is sad and shameful that such things are passed on and hardly anyone sees the true fraud in it 2:37 is by all means solely commercial worthless as an independent film and on a certain level rather a phoney parody of its obvious idol `` elephant '',0
i 'm sorry to see that it has been rated that low by many people the series started off very good and after the first season it was n't that good people tend to forget the beginning of something and only look at the end this is not good to do you should look at the total not the end result it is sad that a lot of the `` usual '' characters died but damn we had a lot of nice new characters please do not attach yourself to a few characters but attach yourself to the series the plot please do understand that i did n't like it when boone died when augur died but well ... it needs to be done can you imagine that everyone keeps living the whole series when they are in a lot of danger all the time come on face it if they did n't die they would be invincible in this way you will always keep the tension will he survive will he die i do realize that people attach their selves to characters i do that too my favorite character was augur the one who could get into every computer he wanted he was the one who was mysterious he could do things with the computer no one else could do i wish to make one statement to all the people who vote negative does a series which started so good deserve to have such low rating should we look at the final season instead of the total should we not see how good the series was when it started should we not see how much we enjoyed it,1
i had to get this movie since it did n't come to where i live i waited patiently and it was worth the wait i totally fell in love with this movie the chemistry between walters and grint you could see since they also worked together on the harry potter movies.the woman who plays his overbearing righteous mother really had me convinced all right and how much of a hypocrite she is i think she did a great job playing the role i only wish we could of had seen the actually sex scene or more of it lol but of course we just have to use our imagination on how it went down snickers i totally thought the movie was worth the wait and if you want a good movie to watch rent this movie i do have to say that rupert really did a great job and it 's nice to see that he 's doing movies outside of harry potter even though i totally love him as ron weasley the whole cast did a great job and i hope rupert continues to act outside of harry potter to broaden his skill,1
i just watched this movie with a few friends they said i had to see it but from the beginning i knew it was going to go from bad to worse so i can only give this movie a 1 because the effects that were used were so poorly used and thought out that anyone can see that there were no `` real '' ghosts i feel the worst part was this so called `` old haunted house '' contained a whole bunch of new items and a few `` convieniently placed items '' i could have thought up effects that would have looked much better than a chair being flipped over by an unseen ghost or should i say wire then later when they review the tape of the chair flipping it flips in a different way uh oh thats a big continuity error if this was a truly good movie then they would have caught that and all of the other `` old house '' items this movie is like a rip off of house on haunted hill and the blair witch project all rolled into one poorly thought out and assembled movie i would be ashamed to put out something with that bad of acting effects and cheap video shots of the girls chests and how convenient the camera falls when something `` paranormal '' happens this movie is an insult to people who are out there actually looking for ghosts and getting real ghost footage on tape,0
i just re-watched a few episodes of this series on very poor vhs tapes that i recorded the series on i 'm glad i did though ramona is based on the children 's books by beverly cleary and follows the adventures of the title eight-year-old sarah polley she has fun with friends and family and gets into trouble much like many eight-year-olds all ten episodes are pretty good `` mystery meal '' kind of grosses me out as a vegan but it 's funny seeing the parents trying to get their kids to eat cow 's tongue and any episode that mentions godzilla versus the smog monster twice ca n't be all bad i like `` ramona 's bad day '' even more although it 's disheartening to see ramona going through a rough day she does imagine herself getting revenge on her friend howie 's uncle a pre-psi factor barclay hope who always teases her `` the perfect day '' is also good lori chodos plays beezus ramona 's sister i swear i 've seen her on something else but imdb does n't list anything besides this show unfortunately this series is not on dvd why is every crappy show made these days on dvd except something i 'd actually like to buy an injustice if there ever was one,1
this movie starts out as if it were a comedy it almost appears that the actors are reading off of cue cards especially in the airport sequence william smith plays the role of `` caribe '' a hunter who is quite twisted and deranged smith seems to always play villains such as in `` the ultimate warrior '' 1975 and `` the frisco kid '' 1979 to name a few although in this film the villainous role seems laughable this is one of those films where senseless things take place only to fill up screen time such as the girl chasing sequence at the beginning and the long silly motorcycle race i give this film 1/10 i would have liked to see this film on `` mystery science theatre '' it would have been hilarious,0
grosse pointe blank was really quite a below average film its hit man theme is very dry and is more like a romantic comedy than a hit man thriller the acting is very normal the performances are extremely embarrassing at times with many characters seeming very 'eccentric and that really annoyed me the whole reunion and the 'wow i have n't seen you in 10 years element is extremely cheesy and many scenes just drag on especially nearer the end when they are at the actual reunion party and the characters are going through each of their former classmates one by one greeting them it just all seemed very tacky pointless and was poorly executed dan akroyd 's role as a 'rival assassin is very sparse he only seems to appear once at the very beginning and right at the very end in a 'final show down which is hugely hyped up but does n't deliver at all the soundtrack is also very mediocre the bulk of the songs that are in this film are straight out of the 1980 's and with the exception of two or three are very bad hearing duff songs over quite a duff film just adds to the negativity that surrounds this film i could go on and on about how little things were annoying and were just very bad such as the very few action sequences that came and went very quickly the lack of character development and how poorly the whole thing was constructed in that department the way that half the time you forget that cusak 's character is even a hit man at all as the element is so non-existent even the way the comedy thinks it 's funny but it is n't i did n't laugh once during this movie sure maybe i smirked now and again but my only real feel good point was when i realised the movie was nearly over please do n't waste your time with 'grosse pointe blank despite the relatively high but badly incorrect imdb rating i 've seen films that are better than this film that have lower rating on this site which tells you that there are better films out there just do n't bother with this one,0
this christmas gift arrived courtesy of tcm we had never seen the film even though we have seen most of the films of barbara stanwyck this comedy made us laugh so much that at times we had to restrain ourselves in order to hear the dialog this is a movie that should be seen by people suffering from stressful situations especially around christmas it would certainly lift one 's spirits by just letting go the movie would make a perfect gift in the form of a dvd or a vhs tape `` christmas in connecticut '' was directed with great panache by peter godfrey based on a story by aileen hamilton the best thing in the movie is the felicitous pairing of two of the most popular stars of that era barbara stanwyck and dennis morgan barbara stanwyck always played strong willed women obviously this was a change of pace for her in this film as well as `` lady eve '' ms. stanwyck displays a knack for comedy she and mr. morgan who played in a lot of musical comedies make a winning combination there are no weak performances in the film sydney greenstreet an actor notorious for playing 'heavies is a delight to watch as the rich and fat alexander yardley the man who owned a media empire and who knew a good thing when he saw it reginald gardiner an accomplished english actor adds luster to the stellar cast behind the two principals s. z. sakall is another source of continuous mirth he plays the hungarian chef felix who has a hard time with his own version of the english language also una o'connor makes a perfect norah the housekeeper in the sloan perfect connecticut farm in reading other comments in this forum it 's sad to learn that the glorious black and white cinematography is not appreciated by some people after all color was not widely used in the 40s and most of the classic movies have to be seen in its original format because what would be accomplished in 'coloring them this film should be a requirement for anyone looking to spend almost two hours of uninterrupted fun at christmas time because total merriment is assured watch it with an open mind and heart an maybe you 'd like to see `` christmas in connecticut '' every year,1
there 's simply no redeeming quality about this film ok some of the costumes are ok but they 're nothing you ca n't see in say the conan flicks and what 's up with ator 's hair i ca n't believe this is part of a series i will say one thing about this film it was deemed bad enough for a righteous lampooning by the early cast of mst3k and i suggest to anyone that 's curious enough to see how bad this film is to watch that version of the film for moral support if nothing else,0

i was n't expecting much from this tale of a kid whose term paper is stolen and turned into a movie script .. who then he travels to hollywood to get even .. but .. hey .. it 's still a fun film frankie muniz of `` malcom in the middle '' fame stars as the kid and is fairly good and amanda bynes as his friend is also very good yea the film does work as an advertisement for universal studios theme park and is really kinda a silly kids film .. but i enjoyed it anyways grade b-,1
this is by far the worst ever 'horror movie no make that any movie i have ever watched shame on block buster for even carrying this type of crap i never ask for a refund on any movie but i think this will be a first the movie is so bad that i had to stop after just 15 minutes of watching it i had more fun watching any of the fuzzy youtube movies than watching this piece of dropping the marketing dude for this movie must have some type of silver tongue to move this thing into an establishment as blockbuster,0
highly recommended to all those who appreciate watching movies great acting perfectly surreal awkward humor requisite prison sh-t accurate depiction of the male condition music is also spot-on i think the artist is `` dip '' but not sure the short loop of the title credit song on the dvd menu is well-timed and sounds like slint one thing to know is that imdb maintains a ridiculous policy of a minimum comment length based on not characters not words but rather lines measuring post quality and quantity based on lines in the bold era of unicode and flexible web-based typography is like smoking poles your comment does not contain enough lines the minimum length for comments is 10 lines of text please see the guidelines attempts to pad the comment with junk words can result in your account being blocked from future submissions,1
this movie may not have seemed like much to some people but it had everything i look for in a comedy fall down funny moments accompanied by a moment or two of seriously moving scenes great actors and pretty much everything a good movie is supposed to be like despite david spade playing his usual snobby character he made this role into an unusual performance which i do n't think he had ever exceeded until he hit the screen with joe dirt regardless of whether or not some people were not chris farley fans i saw this film when it came out and my friends and i still talk about it ... 11 years later this movie was what finally told me that chris farley was the real deal he is the best comedian i have seen in my life in the words of some he could be clumsy clever funny serious crazy sober and moving or depressing at the same time not the same words but the message is all that counts one of the true great actors of our time and one of the true great comedy 's of all time along with good acting good story hilarious moments serious scenes that at times brought me to tears this movie stands atop the hordes as a movie that marked the beginning of a brief reign at the top of the comedy world by the late great chris farley no actor before or since has captured my interests in a movie since because no actor before or since has put so much into his movies this movie is worth the time if you have n't taken the time to see it do so the next time you rent a movie,1
i expected a lot more out of this film the preview looked interesting so i decided to check it out bottom line is that `` the adventures of sebastian cole '' only had one decent thing adrian grenier i really like grenier and found his performance to be very pleasing the character is designed well but everything else sort of just drifts along through the duration of the movie clark gregg is really good but i do n't think that his character was explained too well i mean there 's not too much to explain he wants to become a woman still something was missing the obvious low budget of the film was nice to see i enjoyed that the movie was filmed on just a script a bad one at that and just a few actors it was a nice change while the main idea of the film was actually okay it became disappointing to see a lot of scenes that had nothing to do with it just thrown in here and there like i said the script looked promising and i must say that i was interested where director tod williams was headed but it was basically a very slow movie with not too good of dialogue `` sebastian '' started to look good towards the end but again it fell right back down into a hole the acting was mostly good the writing is in need of some work yet the budget of the film helped it out in the long run i would recommend this to someone if they wanted to watch a quiet movie with a strong lead character but other than that i would stay away personally i would n't watch it twice,0
first and foremost i 'd like to state for the record that it 's incredibly dumb to call your movie `` embryo '' when the subject matter exclusively revolves on scientific research performed on fetuses animal as well as human aged 12-16 weeks the embryonic stage is over at the end of the eighth pregnancy week and from that moment on the unborn critter enters the fetal phase okay in all honestly i did n't know all this but i took the effort of looking it up and that 's the also the least thing the creators of `` embryo '' could have done do n't worry i 'm not just stumbling over details or being exaggeratedly bitter as there are several more reasons to state why `` embryo '' is a huge failure actual science can be considered as boring and inaccessible and thus science fiction is a cinematic genre created especially to make the otherwise tedious yet educational science topics more interesting and comprehensible to larger audiences by depicting ambitious scientific experiments that go horribly wrong or space missions that encounter evil aliens instead of light-years of void filmmakers usually manage to entertain people with spectacular special effects and at the same time teach them useful little trivia about science in order to make a good or at least halfway-decent science fiction movie writers and directors only have to comply with one basic rule do n't be boring if they ca n't fulfill this one condition the viewer might as well read a theoretically accurate book something must have gone wrong during the production of ralph nelson 's `` embryo '' the basic premise is potentially fascinating and even involving as we 're all sensitive about saving the lives of unborn babies there also were some very prominent names involved in the production like main stars rock hudson `` giant '' `` seconds '' diane ladd `` chinatown '' `` alice does n't live here anymore '' and director nelson himself was responsible for the acclaimed classics `` soldier blue '' and `` charly '' then what went wrong simple the script is irredeemably boring clichéd and the whole thing looks incredibly foolish because the lab scenery scientific equipment is clearly too primitive to achieve any medical breakthroughs with rock hudson in a very poor performance plays a doctor who has n't put any passion in his research work ever since his wife passed away when his car hits a pregnant dog on a rainy night his passion returns and he does everything possible to save the dying animals fetuses he manages to keep one fetus alive impressively accelerates its growth process and trains it to become an extremely intelligent dog because his procedure is so successful dr. paul holliston convinces his friend at the hospital to repeat his tests with the human fetus taken from the womb of a pregnant teenager who committed suicide the female subject unexpectedly keeps growing at a fast rate however and after only a couple of weeks she 's a full-grown ravishing and super-intelligent woman the good doctor naturally falls in love with her but the groundbreaking new growth treatment also begins to show horrible side effects ... absolute nothing happens during the first 45 minutes of the film apart from a lot of implausible and overly melodramatic mumbo-jumbo and one or two deeply impressive tricks performed by the dog that second half of the film does contain a little bit of grotesque action and suspense but by then the stupidity of the dialogs and the implausible plot-twists already ruined the potentially fabulous sci-fi idea there are some really cool scenes most notably the chess-showdown between victoria and roddy mcdowall in a highly memorable and ultra-obnoxious supportive role the grand finale is absurdly grotesque and literally on the verge of ridiculous and it almost feels like ralph nelson put in that final disastrous shot because it was the general rule in contemporary thriller sci-fi cinema the last sequence including the horrible freeze-frame shot at the end certainly does n't fit the tone of the previous 100 minutes of the film but anyway my sincere admiration and respect to the dog and his trainers an animal with such intellect and talent surely deserved to demonstrate its tricks in a much better film,0
her embalmed look was totally inappropriate for the role her face remained too white hair too coifed clothes etc too clean and well-fitting especially her father 's old hat and coat in the scene where inman comes home for any sense of accuracy it would be one thing if the production had allowed all the other actors to remain clean and perfect too but she was the only one who did n't get messy there was never even a smudge on her powdered cheek are we to believe she was the only person in the civil war with a bathtub and a mirror she certainly looked like the only one who used them tweezers too i mean what 's with those eyebrows she looked absolutely mean the love story was implausible she only went over to the guy because someone told her that he had said he thought she was cute so she goes over to tease him then flirts with him a couple more times and suddenly this is a love on a par with odysseus and penelope please i should have known better than to expect anything better from the man who brought us `` the english patient '' my reaction to that one was the same as elaine 's on seinfeld `` it sucked '',0

wow another kevin costner hero movie postman tin cup waterworld bodyguard wyatt earp robin hood even that baseball movie seems like he makes movies specifically to be the center of attention the characters are almost always the same ... the heroics the flaws the greatness the fall the redemption yup within the 1st 5 minutes of the movie we 're all supposed to be in awe of his character and it builds up more and more from there and this time the story ... story ... is just a collage of different movies you do n't need a spoiler you 've seen this movie several times though it had different titles you 'll know what will happen way before it happens this is like mixing an officer and a gentleman with backdraft but both are easily better movies watch backdraft to see how this kind of movie should be made ... and also to see how an good but slightly underrated actor russell plays the hero,0
conventional and superficial claude´s portrayal was incomplete it is supposed that just a few moments with sheila makes him win her love but the story itself and the songs make it and enjoyable experience essentially the final sequence .altough i don´t know why it was given a pg rating,1
i hoped for this show to be somewhat realistic it stroke me as just another mainstream show after i watched it i did n't feel the characters at all is this americas glamorized idea of how terrorism operates the main character does n't act like a fundamentalist at all and how he passes for a terrorist is beyond my comprehension neither of the other terrorists managed to appear genuine one of the members a blonde all-american white boy would never be accepted by muslim terrorists in real life another member a french ex-skinhead does n't quite fit in an islamic terror movement on top of this the terrorists have sexual relations to white american housewives which i find very strange this is just another stupid misguiding american tv show it is about just as realistic as prison break,0
`` the student nurses '' is an excellent film that deals with four women bonded by friendship and career for the first time one is able to see a realistic portrayal of relationships inside the work place outside the work place the risks of those relationships and the consequences this film also offers a rare chance to see veteran stage and television actress katherine `` scottie '' macgregor as the nurses instructor `` miss boswell '' ms. macgregor is best known for her performance as `` mrs. oleson '' on the television series `` little house on the prairie '' the direction music and print color are very good as well as the opening theme song performed by clancy b. grass iii this film offers a rare opportunity for those who enjoy themes centered around the late 1960s and early 1970s which offers a `` softer side to life '' while appreciating the beauty of the female sex,1
kk should stick to singing- this whole movie was a big bore i ca n't understand the viciousness of the boys and the romance between miles and kk- the sex scenes were uninspired too the ending was awful- unresolved- there needs to be reason to murder and the whole voyeurism of the boy was weird ..... the mother always wrestled with the boy- do n't you think he would get some rather freudian with her and why did n't someone teach kk how to speak with inflection instead of monotone glad i only paid 1.00 to rent this,0
